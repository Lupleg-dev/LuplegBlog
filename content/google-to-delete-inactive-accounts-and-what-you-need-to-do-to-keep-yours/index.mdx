Google has announced that it will begin deleting inactive accounts in 2023. This means that if you haven't signed in to your Google Account in two years, it may be deleted, along with all of the data associated with it.

### There are a few reasons why Google is doing this.

- First, it helps to free up storage space.

- Second, it helps to protect user privacy. If an account is inactive, it's more likely that the user has forgotten about it or abandoned it. This means that the account may be vulnerable to hacking or other security breaches.

To keep your Google Account active, all you need to do is sign in at least once every two years. You can do this by using any of Google's products or services, such as Gmail, Drive, or YouTube.

If you're worried about forgetting to sign in to your Google Account, you can set up an Inactive Account Manager. This feature allows you to choose what happens to your account if it becomes inactive. For example, you can choose to have your data deleted, or you can choose to have it shared with a trusted contact.

### Here are some tips for keeping your Google Account active:

- Sign in to your Google Account at least once every two years.

- Use Google products and services regularly, such as Gmail, Drive, or YouTube.

- Set up an Inactive Account Manager to choose what happens to your account if it becomes inactive.

If you're not sure whether your Google Account is active, you can sign in to your account and check the "Last sign-in info" section. If it's been more than two years since you last signed in, you'll need to sign in again to keep your account active.

Google will send you multiple notifications before deleting your account. These notifications will be sent to your email address and to your recovery email address, if you have one. If you receive a notification that your account is about to be deleted, you can sign in to your account to keep it active.

If you have any questions about Google's inactive account policy, you can visit the Google Help Center for more information.

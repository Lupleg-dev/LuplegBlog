The Bank of Zambia today held a briefing, announcing an increase in the Monetary Policy Rate by 150 basis points to about 12.5%. This is the highest increase experienced in the last three years.


At the top of the reasons why this has been done is the continued depreciation of the Kwacha against major currencies, resulting in the rate of inflation going further away from what the BoZ had projected. So, the objective of this action is to try and arrest the rising inflation.

As part of its job, the Bank of Zambia is on standby to take even more action if inflation keeps getting out of control as their decisions are informed by inflation and any other factors that are associated with financial stability.

This decision is yet another one that is likely to impact the quality of life, making access to finance much harder than it already is. How exactly is this the case?

Let’s start with understanding what the Monetary Policy Rate actually is. The monetary policy rate is the interest rate set by the Bank of Zambia. It affects how much it costs for banks to borrow money from BoZ and subsequently, how much it costs for you to borrow from the bank.

By changing this rate, the central bank can influence borrowing, spending, and inflation in the economy. The decision to increase the rate simply means borrowing has become more expensive, slowing down the economy.

When the Bank of Zambia increases the policy rate as they have now, commercial banks typically follow suit by raising the interest rates on loans. For borrowers with variable rate loans, such as adjustable rate mortgages or variable rate personal loans, this translates to higher monthly payments. 

As a result, individuals may find themselves spending more on interest payments, which can strain their budgets and potentially lead to financial difficulties, particularly if the increase is substantial.

Granted, people with fixed-rate loans are less directly affected by immediate changes in the policy rate since their interest rates remain constant over the loan term. However, they may miss out on opportunities to refinance at lower rates if interest rates remain high for an extended period. To make this easier to understand, let’s use a practical example, as we usually do.

Today, I’m introducing us to Sammy, a civil servant living in Lusaka. Let’s say Sammy has an active loan for his car, which he obtained from ZedTwitter Bank. The loan has a variable interest rate, meaning that its interest payments can fluctuate with changes in the monetary policy rate set by BoZ.

Because of this increase in the MPR, Sammy now finds himself facing higher monthly payments for his car loan. The increase in interest rates means that he has to allocate more of his monthly income towards servicing the loan. This will probably put a strain on his budget, as he now has less disposable income to cover other expenses such as groceries, utilities, and savings.

With over 2 million loans disbursed in 2023 alone, according to the Credit Market Monitoring Reports, that should tell you that Sammy might just have several other people in his shoes.

It is important to mention that by raising the MPR, BoZ kind of aims to encourage saving, discourage borrowing, and stabilize prices, and this should in turn promote sustainable economic growth and maintain the stability of the Kwacha.

> Primarily though, this specific increase is hoped to help safeguard against potential economic imbalances and mitigate risks of inflation spiralling out of control, ultimately contributing to a healthier and more stable economic environment for businesses and individuals alike.

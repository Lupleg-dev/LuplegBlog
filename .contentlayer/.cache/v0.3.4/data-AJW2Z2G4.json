          "raw": "\nThe African startup ecosystem has been a beacon of innovation and entrepreneurship in recent years, but it has faced yet another setback as capital availability declined in the third quarter (Q3) of the year. The COVID-19 pandemic and economic uncertainties have presented significant challenges for startups across the continent, leading to a drop in fundraising prospects. In this article, we will explore the reasons behind this decline and its potential implications for African startups.\n\n### The Decline in Q3 Capital Availability\n\nAfrican startups have been thriving in various sectors, from fintech and health tech to agritech and e-commerce. However, fundraising for these startups has been challenging in Q3. Several factors have contributed to this decline in capital availability:\n\n- **Economic Uncertainties:** The global economy continues to grapple with uncertainties caused by the ongoing pandemic, inflation, and geopolitical tensions. Investors are becoming more risk-averse, making them hesitant to allocate capital to emerging markets, including Africa.\n\n- **Regulatory Challenges:** In some African countries, regulatory hurdles and uncertainty surrounding cryptocurrency and digital finance have made investors cautious. Fintech startups, which were once a hot investment, are experiencing headwinds.\n\n- **Investor Sentiment:** Investor sentiment plays a significant role in the success of fundraising efforts. In the face of global uncertainties, many investors have opted to hold onto their capital or seek safer investment options, impacting the availability of funding for startups.\n\n- **Impact of Previous Investments:** Some African startups are still grappling with the impact of the pandemic, which disrupted business operations and financial projections. This has made it difficult for them to secure new investments.\n\n### Implications for African Startups\n\nThe decline in capital availability in Q3 is concerning for the African startup ecosystem and has several implications:\n\n- **Slow Growth:** A lack of funding can lead to slower growth for startups. Without capital, it becomes challenging to scale operations, develop new products, or expand into new markets.\n\n- **Talent Retention:** Startups may struggle to attract and retain top talent when they cannot offer competitive salaries and benefits. This could lead to a brain drain and hinder the development of innovative solutions.\n\n- **Innovation Stagnation:** Fewer funds mean fewer resources for research and development, potentially stunting the innovation potential of African startups.\n\n- **Increased Competition:** As access to capital tightens, the competition for available funds becomes fiercer. Startups must vie with one another for the limited pool of investors, intensifying the challenge of securing funding.\n\n- **Diversification:** African startups may need to diversify their fundraising strategies, exploring opportunities like crowdfunding, grants, and partnerships with international organizations to bridge the funding gap.\n\n### Potential Solutions\n\nWhile the decline in Q3 capital availability is a challenge, African startups can take proactive measures to weather the storm and continue their growth trajectory:\n\n- **Building Resilience:** Startups should focus on building financial resilience by optimizing their operations, reducing costs, and maximizing revenue streams.\n\n- **Diversifying Funding Sources:** In addition to traditional venture capital, startups can explore alternative funding sources like grants, impact investment, and partnerships with established corporations.\n\n- **Strengthening Regulatory Compliance:** Fintech startups should prioritize regulatory compliance to instill confidence in investors and foster a more conducive investment environment.\n\n- **Regional Collaboration:** African governments and organizations can promote regional collaboration and harmonize regulatory frameworks to attract more investment.\n\n- **Demonstrating Impact:** Startups should emphasize their social and economic impact, which can be a strong motivator for impact investors.\n\n> The decline in capital availability in Q3 poses a significant challenge to African startups, but it is not an insurmountable obstacle. By building resilience, diversifying funding sources, and demonstrating their impact, African startups can continue to grow and innovate. Furthermore, addressing regulatory challenges and promoting regional collaboration can contribute to a more stable and conducive investment environment, ensuring that the African startup ecosystem remains a hotbed of innovation and entrepreneurship.\n",

          "raw": "\nThe laptop, which starts at $2,500 (plus some pricey add-ons), splits the difference between the Mac Studio and MacBook Air\n\nThis thing is a beast — in pretty much every sense. It’s a big, heavy, powerful system, with a bright display, massive battery life and impressive power under the hood. After opening the box, I immediately ported all the contents over from the 15-inch Air I’ve been using daily for several months now, but still, the 16-inch MacBook Pro feels like a different species.\n\nEach has their place. I’m hopping on another cross-country flight tomorrow, and I’m planning to leave the 16-inch Pro at home. This is due partially to an ongoing back injury, but frankly, for as good as the Pro’s battery life is (very good, for the record), the Air is a much better travel companion. It’s thin, it’s light, it has more than enough processing power for 95% of the things 95% of people need, and it won’t wrestle you for the arm rest.\n\nI’ve begun thinking of the 16-inch MacBook Pro as something more along the lines of a portable desktop. That is to say that the M3 Max is plenty powerful for even most professional uses. The chip also affords the laptop the ability to power up to four external displays, making it a fine workstation option for many. When it’s time to take your work home (assuming you don’t live in France), you can pop it in your bag and take it with you. I would recommend against taking your work (and large laptop) home with you every night, but you do you.\n\n\nThe new MacBook Pro, which goes on sale this week, was announced at last week’s Scary Fast event, alongside a new iMac and — of course — several members of the M3 line. That latter bit marked a big departure for the company, following rumors that Apple had planned the initial M3 launch for WWDC. The supply chain ultimately thought different(ly). What announcing the M3, M3 Pro and M3 Max at once affords the company, however, is options — though less so for the M3-only iMac.\n\nBetween the 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros, you’ve got all three configurations covered. Presumably an M3 Ultra is also on the way in the not-too-distant future, but will almost certainly be confined to desktops like the Mac Studio, and Mac Pro, owing to the limitations of system architectures. Apple also recently shot down rumors surrounding a 27-inch iMac. The 14-inch MacBook Pro can be configured with any of the three new chips, while the 16-inch is limited to just the Pro and Max.\n\n\nApple sent us the 16-inch with the M3 Max. The company, understandably, likes to put its best foot forward with this stuff (so yes, it’s also the Space Black model). The Max comes in both 14-core CPU/30-core GPU and 16-core CPU/40-core GPU flavors. Again, the one I am typing this on falls into the latter camp. That also means 48GB of memory and 1TB of storage by default. It’s a $4,000 computer, as configured. If you want to bump the memory and storage up to 128GB and 8TB, respectively, it comes to $7,200. That’s a pretty hefty increase from the base level 14- and 16-inch models, which run $1,600 and $2,500 to start.\n\nApple lowered the barrier of entry for the lowest end model, but — as ever — upgrades start to add up quickly. We’re talking about a real investment here for you — or better yet, your company. It’s certainly a system that’s likely to last you a while. It’s true that Apple is currently on a one-year upgrade cycle for it first-party M-series chips, but it’s genuinely tough to imagine and advanced as pronounced as the one it made from Intel to in-house silicon happening any time soon. There’s no such thing as a future-proofed laptop, so the best you can hope for is one that will give you good mileage. That certainly applies here.\n\nAlong with building new chips, Apple has spent the last few years listening to consumers in a way it hadn’t for decades. That means finally updating the camera, building a better keyboard (the class action settlement probably tipped the scales as well) and ditching the well-meaning but ultimately ineffectual Touch Bar altogether. In fact, it shouldn’t go unremarked upon that the arrival of the new 14-inch signaled the merciful end to that particular technology, as the last Touch Bar Mac — the 13-inch Pro — was replaced by the new 14-inch model.\n\n\nI would say, more than anything, the thing I miss moving from the MacBook Pro to the Air is the ports. True story: At last year’s CES, I had to locate an Apple Store in the Venetian because my external SD reader failed (I won’t say which TechCrunch staff member laughed at me in that predicament, but they know who they are). I understand that an SD reader is kind of a niche need in these days of everyone shooting everything on their, so I can at least understand Apple’s justification for keeping it to the Pro system (the new iMac doesn’t have one, either).\n\nPorts are a different story. More ports is better. It’s simple math. People can’t get enough of the things. The Pro has three Thunderbolt 4/USB-C ports to the Air’s two. Also, for some reason, all of the ports (save for the headphone jack) are all on the same side with the Air. Things can get crowded fast. Both systems have the latest MagSafe connector — though I’d like to point out that despite being a bespoke charger, you’re able to top the laptops up faster via Thunderbolt. The other important addition on the Pro side is an HDMI port, which is key for the aforementioned external display support.\n\nFrom an industrial design perspective, not much has changed here from the 2021 model. Apple settled into a look it likes, balancing rounded edges with a flat, almost boxy design that isn’t dissimilar from the iPhone in that respect. On top is the familiar reflective Apple logo, while “MacBook Pro” is etched into the bottom. Around that, you’ll see a series of small screws that signal the company’s newfound push into repairability spurred on by the broader call for right to repair legislation. There is also a heat vent on either side.\n\nL-R: Space Black MacBook Pro, Space Gray Touchbar MacBook Pro\n\nThe Pros are a good bit thicker than the Air. The 14- and 16-inch are 0.61 and 0.66 inches tall, respectively, versus the 15-inch Air’s 0.45 inches. This is due, in no small part to the Pros’ inclusion of a fan and airflow system. You’re unlikely to trigger the fan during most everyday operations, but more complex tasks like 3D rendering require a lot of compute power, so it’s there when you need it. Meanwhile, the 14-inch Pro (3.4 pounds) weighs just a hair more than the 15-inch Air (3.3 pounds). At 4.7/4.8 pounds (for the M3 Pro and Max), there’s a pronounced increase with the 16-inch Pro.\n\nApple fans love a new color. In the case of the MacBook line, it could be attributable to the fact that there’s little variation in the laptops’ aluminum design. The last few generations have traded almost exclusively in space gray and silver (dark and light gray, essentially). The new Airs opened this up a bit, however, with the addition of starlight (a subtle light-gold) and midnight (a much darker gray). The space black is a nice addition. It gives off a nice glow when the light hits it. The biggest thing here, however, is the fingerprint factor. The Airs I’ve tested were silver and starlight, so I can’t really speak to this directly, but the midnight Air is a notorious fingerprint magnet. There are pages and pages of conversations about it on Reddit, including “tips” for a fingerprint-free midnight Mac. Have you tried typing in gloves? Not easy.\n\nApple describes the new color in the most Apple way possible, “The finish features a breakthrough chemistry that forms an anodization seal to greatly reduce fingerprints.” The company hasn’t perfected the wholly fingerprint-proof surface, but the new finish does an excellent job keeping things to a minimum.\n\n\nBoth new Pro models are built around Apple’s Liquid Retina XDR display. The 14-inch sports 3024 x 1964 pixels to the 16’s 3456 x 2234 pixels — both come out to a pixel density of 254 ppi. The 15-inch Air, meanwhile, has a 224 ppi density. The 16-inch system’s display is largely unchanged from the 2021 model. It has a 1000 nit sustained brightness and 1600 nit peak with HDR (high dynamic range) content. For SDR (standard dynamic range) content, however, brightness has been bumped up from a 500 to 600 nits max.\n\nBack in April 2021, the company finally started bumping its webcams from 720p to 1080p. It was a long-awaited refresh for a company that puts so much emphasis on its mobile imaging. The new hardware was coupled with improvements brought on by the M1’s on-board digital signal processing. While the camera hardware has remained the same since, updates to the chips have further tweaked picture quality. As it stands now, the webcam is totally fine, and the addition of portrait and studio lighting modes further improve its. Portrait mode does still have some trouble with edges. I wear over-ear headphones while podcasting, and it hasn’t quit figured out what to do with the gap between the band and my head.\n\nTop: The MacBook’s built-in webcam. Bottom: iPhone 15 Pro Max with Continuity Camera\n\nFrankly, however, Apple’s biggest enemy here is itself. Continuity Camera is a game changer for many. The system lets a mounted iPhone take over webcam duties, and there’s really no comparing the two. I never go on a trip without the Belkin MagSafe camera mount.\n\nThe on-board speaker and microphone systems, meanwhile, remain mostly unchanged from the 2021 M1 Pro. There are six speakers, with two large grilles on either side of the keyboard. The system supports both Spatial Audio and Dolby Atmos. It’s not an exceptional speaker system, but it gets the job done. The Pro also has a three-mic array with directional beamforming.\n\n\nThe M3 line is the first of Apple’s desktop chips to be created using the 3nm process, following the iPhone 15 Pro’s lead. Apple has employed the 5nm process since the 2020’s M1 introduction. The new process brings performance gains with less power consumption, and the Mac is the first PC line to employ the technology.\n\nGaming continues to be an important narrative for Apple’s silicon journey, and it was very much at the heart of last week’s M3 announcements. GPU updates were the centerpiece of the news for several reasons. One is a feature the company calls Dynamic Caching. Apple writes,\n\nWith Dynamic Caching, only the exact amount of memory needed is used for each task. This is an industry first, transparent to developers, and the cornerstone of the new GPU architecture. It dramatically increases the average utilization of the GPU, which significantly increases performance for the most demanding pro apps and games.\n\nMore simply put, the idea is allocating just the right amount of local memory to a given task. It’s something Apple has been working on for a while. The other two additions should be more familiar for anyone who’s spent time behind a game controller. The first is ray tracing, a feature designed to bring added realism to the gaming experience, though more accurate depictions of lighting and reflections.\n\nThat feature is now hardware-accelerated, along with mesh shading. The triangle computer shader makes processing complex geometrical images more efficient. That, in turn, allows for higher-quality graphics and more scene detail.\n\nThe results are impressive. I’ve been spending a bit of time with the Soulslike title, Lies of P. It’s basically Pinocchio with more swords. It’s of a small – but increasing – number of day-and-date releases for macOS. A couple of years ago, it would have been inconceivable for the operating system to get the game the same day as PS5, Xbox Series X/S and Windows. That said, the macOS gaming library still has a long way to go.\n\nIndeed, the gameplay was smooth and detailed – something that also would have seemed impossible not all that long ago. Sony’s PS5 DualShock controller connects seamlessly and makes for a fun portable gaming experience.\n\nOne thing I noticed during last week’s presentation is that Apple is leaning less heavily on Intel comparisons. There were still a few during the event, but four-year-old non-proprietary chips are no longer the main point of comparison. Enough time and upgrades have elapsed since the M1 arrived. In fact, this Friday marks three years since it was announced. Apple again,\n\nRendering speeds are now up to 2.5x faster than on the M1 family of chips. The CPU performance cores and efficiency cores are 30 percent and 50 percent faster than those in M1, respectively, and the Neural Engine is 60 percent faster than the Neural Engine in the M1 family of chips.\n\nIt’s worth pointing out here that Apple’s chip numbering system isn’t as straight forward as it seems at first blush. For instance, while the M3 represents an advance over the M2, you can still expect to see, say, the M2 Ultra to outperform the M3. Pros, Maxes and Ultras are progressively larger versions of their baseline chip, containing more CPU, GPU and neural engine cores. The Ultra, for example, is for all in intents and purposes, two Maxes stitched together. There are other factors at play as well, like the fact that Mac Studio and Mac Pro do a better job with heat dissipation, while the MacBook Pros are more equipped than the fan-less Airs, which throttle performance more quickly due to heat.\n\nThere are still a handful of ways, however, that even the baseline M3 will outperform the M2 Ultra. Two clear instances are ray tracing and mesh shading, which were previously software-accelerated.\n\nWith Blackmagic Disk Speed, which measures SSD performance, the 16-inch Pro scored 6367 write and 5057 read speeds, vs. the Mac Studio’s 6648/5716. Running Geekbench 6, the system scored 3149 on the single-core test and 21269 multi-core. That’s a nice bump over the M3 iMac’s 3024/11810. In our Mac Studio review, the M2 Ultra got 2819 single and 21507 multi-core. Taking a step back in time to Geekbench 5 (which we’ve been running on M-series systems from the outset), the M3 Max gets a single-core score of 2323 and 23190 on the multi-core. That’s a big performance increase over the M3 iMac’s 2191/10619 and the M2 Max 14-inch Pro‘s 1952/15249.\n\nThe M3 Max powering our Pro sports 16 CPU cores — that’s 12 performance and 4 efficiency — while the GPU packs in a whopping 40 cores. On Cinebench 2024, it scored 142 for single-core and 1693 with the multi-core, compared to the M3 Max’s 138/617. You can see a pattern emerging. The M3 Max outperforms the M3 on everything (no surprise there) and the M2 Ultra on several single-core tests, while often coming within spitting distance with some of the multi-core tests.\n\nWith GeekBench 6 Metal, which tests GPU performance during complex tasks, the M3 Max scored an average of 153273. That’s a nice increase over the M2 Max’s 131883 average, while still getting trounced by the M2 Ultra’s 208584. AMD’s cards still best even the top-performing Apple chips by a good margin, with the Radeon RX 6900XT scoring 242924.\n\nRelative to its own family of chips, the M3 Max is doing impressive things, given that the M2 Ultra tops out at a 24-core CPU, 76-core GPU and 32-core neural engine. The Mac Studio’s large body and airflow system are also much more equipped to dissipate heat, when compared to the MacBook Pro’s compact profile. I will say, however, that I have so far only triggered the fan during benchmarking. The Cinebench test was run with the system in high-power mode, a setting that prioritizes performance over battery life. Low-power mode, naturally, does the inverse, while automatic (the default setting) does its best to split the difference.\n\nAnd Finally\n\nHonestly, though, the battery might be the most exceptional bit here. The first thing I did upon receiving the system (after setup and charging) was a video rundown — far and away the most lengthy part of testing. I looped a single movie (Bill & Ted Face the Music, for the record) in Apple TV, with brightness and volume at their default settings. I kicked it off at 4:45PM on Tuesday, and it ran until 7:30 the following evening. That’s a runtime of 26 hours, 45 minutes. This thing is going to get you through your next flight, no problem.\n\nHowever, if you’re flying a lot and want a MacBook travel companion, I still recommend the 15-inch Air. It continues to be the best MacBook for the vast majority of users. The 14-inch Pro is worth looking at gaming is important — though I’m still a long way off from recommending any Macs are pure gaming machines. The 16-inch is the pick for those who really need to up their professional game, but still need some portability. For pure desktop power, the Mac Studio and Mac Pro with the M2 Ultra is still king — until the M3 Ultra rolls out.\n\n> To state the obvious, the 16-inch MacBook Pro with M3 Max is the most powerful Apple laptop, ever. You’ll still get more performance out of the M2 Ultra in the Mac Studio, but for most intents and purposes, this is the desktop of laptops. It’s big, heavy, expensive and powerful.\n",

Others are able to boot up the device but don't have access to lock storage, which causes a huge amount of issues. Some users likened the bug to \"ransomware,\" a type of malware that encrypts your local storage and then demands money for your data.

Google usually rolls updates out slowly so it can pull them if issues like this pop up to minimize damage. That didn't happen here, though. Google failed to respond quickly to initial reports and just let the bug roll out to everyone. Some people even report being freshly hit with the bug just four days ago because Google 1) let the update roll out without stopping it and 2) can't patch its software quickly enough. The biggest issue tracker thread on this bug is up to 1,000-plus likes and 850 comments of people locked out of their devices, and it took two separate rounds of news coverage for Google to acknowledge the bug after about 20 days.\n\nGoogle promised a rescue patch, which is now arriving, though the company said only \"some\" data would be recoverable and that \"this update may not enable data to be recovered for devices that are repeatedly rebooting.\" That seems to line up with what people are experiencing now that the OTA is out. People who can boot up report fixed devices, while bootloopers aren't getting anywhere. Some users are still in the support thread hoping for some kind of data recovery for bootlooping devices, but it doesn't seem like that is going to happen.\n\nThis whole fiasco has been a complete failure of most of the controls and protections Google has in place in Android. The company slowly rolls out updates to stop problems before it hits a wide number of users, but it failed to pull the update when problems arose. Android has dual system partitions so that you always have a backup if the device fails to boot after an update, but that system didn't work here because Google's \"boot failure\" detection isn't accurate enough.

This automation can significantly boost productivity, reduce errors, and free up developers to focus on more creative and challenging aspects of their work. Below, I'll provide a detailed explanation of this concept, including its importance, common automation techniques, and tools used by developers.\n\n### Importance of Automating Repetitive Tasks:\n\n- **Time Efficiency:** Repetitive tasks consume a significant amount of a developer's time. Automating these tasks allows developers to complete them faster, leaving more time for more critical and innovative work.\n\n- **Error Reduction:** Manual tasks are prone to human error. Automation helps eliminate or minimize errors, leading to more reliable code and fewer debugging sessions.\n\n- **Consistency:** Automation ensures that tasks are performed consistently, following predefined rules and standards, which is crucial for maintaining code quality and project consistency.\n\n- **Reduced Monotony:** Repetitive tasks can be monotonous and demotivating. Automation frees developers from these tedious activities, improving job satisfaction.\n\n### Common Automation Techniques for Developers:\n\n- **Scripting and Automation Languages:** Developers often use scripting languages like Python, PowerShell, or JavaScript to create scripts and automation routines. These scripts can be employed for tasks such as file manipulation, data processing, and even server provisioning.\n\n- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):** CI/CD pipelines automate the build, test, and deployment processes. Tools like Jenkins, Travis CI, and GitLab CI/CD automate code integration, testing, and deployment to various environments.\n\n- **Task Runners:** Task runners like Grunt, Gulp, or Webpack automate repetitive front-end development tasks such as minification, compilation, and bundling of assets.\n\n- **Configuration Management:** Tools like Ansible, Puppet, and Chef help automate server and infrastructure provisioning, configuration, and maintenance.\n\n- **Containerization and Orchestration:** Docker and Kubernetes allow developers to automate the packaging and deployment of applications within containers, making it easier to manage dependencies and scale applications.\n\n- **Code Generation:** Code generators like Yeoman or tools built into frameworks like Ruby on Rails can create boilerplate code and reduce the need for manual coding.\n\n- **Text Editors and IDEs:** Text editors and integrated development environments (IDEs) often offer automation features like code snippets, templates, and macros, which can help developers write code faster.\n\n- **Testing Automation:** Test automation frameworks like Selenium, JUnit, or PyTest automate the execution of test cases, ensuring that code changes don't introduce regressions.\n\n### Tools for Automating Repetitive Tasks:\n\n- **Version Control Systems (VCS):** Git, SVN, and Mercurial enable automation of code versioning and collaboration, reducing the manual effort required for code management.\n\n- **Automation Servers:** Jenkins, Travis CI, CircleCI, and GitLab CI/CD are popular tools for automating the software development lifecycle.\n\n- **Configuration Management Tools:** Ansible, Puppet, and Chef automate server and infrastructure configuration.\n\n- **Containerization Platforms:** Docker and Kubernetes are widely used for automating application deployment and management.\n\n- **Package Managers:** Tools like npm, pip, and gem automate the installation and management of project dependencies.\n\n- **Task Runners:** Grunt, Gulp, and Webpack automate front-end development tasks.\n\n- **Code Generators:** Yeoman and Rails generators automate code generation.\n\n- **Text Editors and IDEs:** Editors like Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, and Vim offer plugins and extensions for task automation.\n\n> In conclusion, automating repetitive tasks is a crucial productivity hack for developers. By leveraging various automation techniques and tools, developers can save time, reduce errors, improve consistency, and enhance job satisfaction. This ultimately leads to more efficient development processes and higher-quality software products.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Clean code is not only easier to read and understand but also simpler to maintain, debug, and extend. In this article, we will delve into the best practices for writing clean and maintainable code.\n\n### 1. Follow a Consistent Coding Style:\n\nConsistency in coding style makes it easier for developers to understand and collaborate on a project. Choose a coding style guide and adhere to it. Popular choices include the PEP 8 style guide for Python, the Google Java Style Guide for Java, and the Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide for JavaScript.\n\n### 2. Use Descriptive and Meaningful Names:\n\nVariable and function names should be clear, concise, and descriptive. Avoid single-letter variable names or cryptic abbreviations. A well-named variable or function should provide context about its purpose and usage.\n\n### 3. Keep Functions and Methods Small:\n\nFollow the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) by ensuring that functions and methods have a single, well-defined purpose. Smaller functions are easier to read, test, and maintain. If a function is too long, consider breaking it into smaller, more focused functions.\n\n### 4. Write Self-Documenting Code:\n\nStrive to make your code as self-explanatory as possible. Use meaningful variable names and add comments sparingly. Ideally, code should be so clear that comments are only needed for complex or non-obvious logic.\n\n### 5. DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) Principle:\n\nAvoid duplicating code. If you find yourself copying and pasting the same code in multiple places, consider encapsulating it in a function or method that can be reused.\n\n### 6. Modularize Your Code:\n\nDivide your code into modules or classes with well-defined responsibilities. This helps organize your codebase and makes it easier to manage and test. Each module or class should have a clear purpose and minimal dependencies on other parts of the system.\n\n### 7. Use Version Control:\n\nUtilize version control systems like Git to track changes to your code. This allows you to collaborate with others, revert to previous versions if issues arise, and maintain a clean history of your codebase.\n\n### 8. Write Unit Tests:\n\nAutomated testing is essential for maintaining code quality. Write unit tests to ensure that individual components of your code work correctly. Continuous Integration (CI) tools can automatically run these tests whenever changes are made.\n\n### 9. Document Your Code:\n\nProvide clear and up-to-date documentation for your code, including high-level overviews, API documentation, and usage examples. Good documentation helps other developers understand how to use your code effectively.\n\n### 10. Handle Errors Gracefully:\n\nAlways include error handling in your code. When errors occur, provide meaningful error messages and handle exceptions gracefully. This makes your code more robust and user-friendly.\n\n### 11. Avoid Magic Numbers and Strings:\n\nAvoid using \"magic\" numbers or strings directly in your code. Instead, define constants or configuration variables to make your code more maintainable and easier to modify.\n\n### 12. Review and Refactor Code Regularly:\n\nPeriodically review your codebase and look for opportunities to refactor and improve it. Refactoring helps eliminate code smells, enhances performance, and keeps the codebase clean and maintainable.\n\n### 13. Follow Design Patterns:\n\nDesign patterns are proven solutions to common software design problems. Familiarize yourself with design patterns and use them where appropriate to promote code reusability and maintainability.\n\n### 14. Keep Dependencies Up to Date:\n\nRegularly update and maintain your project's dependencies, libraries, and frameworks. Outdated dependencies can introduce security vulnerabilities and compatibility issues.\n\n### 15. Seek Peer Review:\n\nEncourage peer code reviews to get feedback from other developers. Peer reviews help identify issues, improve code quality, and promote knowledge sharing within the team.\n\n> In conclusion, writing clean and maintainable code is a continuous process that requires discipline and collaboration. Following these best practices will not only make your codebase more manageable but also enhance the productivity and satisfaction of you and your team throughout the software development lifecycle. Remember that clean code is an investment in the future of your project, as it reduces technical debt and makes future development and maintenance smoother.\n\n**Example of clean code**\n```def factorial(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        result = 1\n        for i in range(1, n + 1):\n            result *= i\n        return result\n```\nThe above example is the illustration on how clean code look like.\n\n\n\n\n",

          "raw": "\n\n\nBuilding Progressive Web Apps - Bridging the Gap Between Web and Mobile is a cutting-edge approach to web development that combines the best of both web and mobile technologies. This approach allows developers to create applications that offer a seamless user experience on a wide range of devices, from desktop computers to smartphones and tablets. Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) have gained significant popularity in recent years due to their ability to provide fast, reliable, and engaging web experiences, even in challenging network conditions.\n\nIntegrating mindfulness practices into the process of building Progressive Web Apps can have a profound impact on the development workflow and the well-being of developers. Mindfulness practices are techniques that encourage individuals to be fully present and attentive to their current moment, helping them develop a deeper understanding of their work, reduce stress, and enhance their work-life balance. Here's a more detailed explanation of how mindfulness can benefit PWA development:\n\n**Enhancing Focus:** Mindfulness practices, such as meditation and deep breathing exercises, can improve a developer's ability to concentrate on the task at hand. This heightened focus is crucial when working on complex PWA projects, which require attention to detail and precision in coding.\n\n**Problem-Solving:** Mindfulness techniques encourage a calm and clear mindset, making it easier for developers to tackle complex problems and bugs. When developers are mindful, they can approach coding challenges with a more creative and open-minded perspective, potentially leading to more innovative solutions.\n\n**Stress Reduction:** Building Progressive Web Apps can be a demanding and high-pressure task. Mindfulness practices are effective tools for managing stress and preventing burnout, which can be common in the tech industry. Reducing stress levels among developers can improve their overall well-being and job satisfaction.\n\n**Work-Life Balance:** The nature of web development often leads to long hours and a blurring of the line between work and personal life. Mindfulness can help developers set boundaries and maintain a healthier work-life balance. This balance is essential for long-term job satisfaction and avoiding burnout.\n\n**Improved Collaboration:** Mindfulness practices also enhance interpersonal skills, making it easier for developers to communicate effectively with their team members. Clear communication is essential when working on PWA projects, where collaboration is often key to success.\n\n**Quality Assurance:** Mindfulness can promote a greater sense of responsibility and attentiveness in the development process, which can lead to a higher standard of code quality and user experience. This is vital in the context of Progressive Web Apps, where the user experience is paramount.\n\n> In summary, integrating mindfulness practices into the development process of Progressive Web Apps is a powerful way to enhance the productivity and well-being of developers. By fostering present-moment awareness and promoting focus, problem-solving, stress reduction, and work-life balance, developers can create better PWAs and maintain a healthier work environment. Mindful developers are better equipped to meet the challenges of PWA development and deliver exceptional web experiences to users across various devices.\n\nWhen it comes to building Progressive Web Apps (PWAs), there are several important tips to consider in order to create successful and user-friendly applications. Here are some key tips to keep in mind:\n\n### Start with a Solid Mobile-First Strategy: \n\nPWAs should be designed with mobile devices in mind from the beginning. This means optimizing for smaller screens, touch interfaces, and varying network conditions. A responsive and mobile-first approach is crucial.\n\n### Focus on Performance: \n\nOne of the main benefits of PWAs is their speed and performance. Optimize your PWA to load quickly and work smoothly, even on slower connections. Use techniques like lazy loading and image optimization to enhance performance.\n\n### Offline Capabilities: \n\nPWAs should work offline or in low-network conditions. Consider using service workers to cache essential assets and content. This ensures that users can still access your PWA even without an internet connection.\n\n### Engaging User Experience: \n\nPWAs should provide a user experience that is comparable to native mobile apps. Pay attention to design, animations, and intuitive navigation to keep users engaged and coming back.\n\n### App-Like Behavior: \n\nAim to make your PWA feel like a native app. Utilize features like app icons, push notifications, and home screen installation to create a seamless experience for users.\n\n### Security: \n\nSecurity is paramount. Ensure your PWA is served over HTTPS to protect user data and build trust. Implement security best practices to prevent common web vulnerabilities.\n\n### Accessibility: \n\nMake your PWA accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. Follow accessibility guidelines to ensure that everyone can use your application.\n\n### Cross-Browser Compatibility: \n\nTest your PWA on various browsers and devices to ensure it works consistently across platforms. Use progressive enhancement techniques to handle browser differences gracefully.\n\n### Optimize for SEO: \n\nSearch engine optimization is crucial for discoverability. Make sure your PWA is search engine-friendly by providing appropriate metadata and ensuring good content structure.\n\n### Progressive Enhancement: \n\nStart with a core experience that works on all devices and browsers, and then progressively enhance it with additional features for more capable devices and browsers. This ensures a broad reach while taking advantage of advanced capabilities where available.\n\n### Test, Test, Test: \n\nThoroughly test your PWA on real devices and in real-world conditions. This includes testing different network speeds, devices, and usage scenarios.\n\n### Performance Monitoring: \n\nUse performance monitoring tools to continuously assess your PWA's speed and performance. This will help you identify and address any performance bottlenecks.\n\n### User Feedback: \n\nGather feedback from users and be open to making improvements based on their suggestions and experiences. Feedback is invaluable for refining your PWA.\n\n### Documentation: \n\nCreate clear and comprehensive documentation for your PWA. This is essential for both your development team and potential collaborators.\n\n### Keep Up with Web Standards: \n\nStay updated with web standards, technologies, and best practices. The web landscape is continually evolving, and it's important to adapt to new developments.\n\n### Compliance with Legal and Privacy Regulations: \n\nEnsure that your PWA complies with legal and privacy regulations, including GDPR and other data protection laws.\n\n### Continuous Updates: \n\nRegularly update your PWA to fix bugs, add new features, and improve performance. Keeping your PWA up-to-date is essential for maintaining user engagement.\n\n> By following these tips, you can create a high-quality Progressive Web App that offers a great user experience and helps bridge the gap between web and mobile, ultimately benefiting your users and your business.",

          "raw": "\nIn a recent announcement that sent shockwaves through the automotive industry and the investment world, Tesla CEO Elon Musk delivered a sobering message: the highly-anticipated Cybertruck, one of the company's most ambitious projects, won't turn a profit until 2025. This revelation comes as a surprise to many, as the Cybertruck was initially touted as a game-changer that would revolutionize the electric vehicle market. In this article, we'll delve into the reasons behind Musk's prediction and its potential implications for Tesla's future and the electric vehicle industry as a whole.\n\n### The Hype Surrounding the Cybertruck\n\nWhen Elon Musk unveiled the Cybertruck in November 2019, the world watched in amazement. The vehicle's futuristic design, boasting angular lines and stainless steel exoskeleton, seemed like a vehicle straight out of a science fiction movie. The promise of an all-electric pickup truck with impressive specs, including up to 500 miles of range and blistering acceleration, quickly drew the attention of automotive enthusiasts and investors alike. Thousands of pre-orders were placed within days of the Cybertruck's announcement, underscoring the immense interest in Tesla's latest creation.\n\n### The Rocky Road to Profitability\n\nDespite the initial fanfare, the path to profitability for the Cybertruck has proven to be challenging. Several factors have contributed to Elon Musk's cautious projection:\n\n### Production Challenges:\n\nManufacturing an unconventional vehicle like the Cybertruck has presented unforeseen hurdles. The unique exoskeleton design and stainless steel construction have been difficult to mass-produce, resulting in delays and increased production costs.\n\n### Market Competition:\n\nThe electric vehicle market has become increasingly competitive. Traditional automakers, as well as new entrants, are now offering their electric pickups, putting pressure on Tesla to deliver a standout product and maintain market share.\n\n### Rising Material Costs:\n\nThe Cybertruck's stainless steel exoskeleton, while a unique selling point, is more expensive to manufacture than traditional materials used in pickup trucks. This has added to the vehicle's overall cost, squeezing profit margins.\n\n### Regulatory Challenges:\n\nChanging regulations and safety standards have also posed challenges. Tesla has had to make adjustments to the Cybertruck's design and features to meet evolving requirements, adding to development and production costs.\n\n### Gigafactory Constraints:\n\nTesla's Gigafactories, where the Cybertruck is expected to be produced, are facing capacity constraints and supply chain disruptions, further affecting production efficiency.\n\n### Implications for Tesla and the Industry\n\nElon Musk's warning that the Cybertruck may not turn a profit until 2025 has a significant impact on Tesla and the electric vehicle industry:\n\n### Tesla's Financial Health:\n\nWhile Tesla has been a high-growth company, it faces increasing pressure from investors to demonstrate consistent profitability. The delay in the Cybertruck's profitability could affect Tesla's stock price and the company's access to capital for future projects.\n\n### Customer Expectations:\n\nThe Cybertruck's delays could test the patience of eager customers who have pre-ordered the vehicle. Managing customer expectations and ensuring a high-quality product upon delivery will be crucial for Tesla's reputation.\n\n### Competitive Landscape:\n\nThe delay in profitability gives competitors more time to catch up and potentially gain ground in the electric pickup market. Traditional automakers like Ford and General Motors are investing heavily in their electric truck offerings, increasing competition.\n\n### Technological Advancements:\n\nThe automotive industry is constantly evolving, and the delay in the Cybertruck's profitability could mean missing out on advancements in battery technology, autonomous driving, and other innovations that could impact the vehicle's competitiveness.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n> Elon Musk's warning that the Cybertruck won't be profitable until 2025 is a stark reminder of the complexities and challenges of bringing a groundbreaking product to market. While the Cybertruck initially captured imaginations and generated significant interest, the road to profitability is proving to be longer and more challenging than anticipated. Tesla and its CEO face the difficult task of balancing innovation, market competition, and profitability as they navigate the future of the electric vehicle industry. Only time will tell whether the Cybertruck will live up to its initial promise and become a game-changing success.\n",

          "raw": "\nGoogle has announced that it will begin deleting inactive accounts in 2023. This means that if you haven't signed in to your Google Account in two years, it may be deleted, along with all of the data associated with it.\n\n### There are a few reasons why Google is doing this.\n\n- First, it helps to free up storage space.\n\n- Second, it helps to protect user privacy. If an account is inactive, it's more likely that the user has forgotten about it or abandoned it. This means that the account may be vulnerable to hacking or other security breaches.\n\nTo keep your Google Account active, all you need to do is sign in at least once every two years. You can do this by using any of Google's products or services, such as Gmail, Drive, or YouTube.\n\nIf you're worried about forgetting to sign in to your Google Account, you can set up an Inactive Account Manager. This feature allows you to choose what happens to your account if it becomes inactive. For example, you can choose to have your data deleted, or you can choose to have it shared with a trusted contact.\n\n### Here are some tips for keeping your Google Account active:\n\n- Sign in to your Google Account at least once every two years.\n\n- Use Google products and services regularly, such as Gmail, Drive, or YouTube.\n\n- Set up an Inactive Account Manager to choose what happens to your account if it becomes inactive.\n\nIf you're not sure whether your Google Account is active, you can sign in to your account and check the \"Last sign-in info\" section. If it's been more than two years since you last signed in, you'll need to sign in again to keep your account active.\n\nGoogle will send you multiple notifications before deleting your account. These notifications will be sent to your email address and to your recovery email address, if you have one. If you receive a notification that your account is about to be deleted, you can sign in to your account to keep it active.\n\nIf you have any questions about Google's inactive account policy, you can visit the Google Help Center for more information.\n\n### Summary\n\nGoogle will begin deleting inactive accounts in 2023. An inactive account is one that has not been signed in to for two years. Google is doing this to free up storage space and protect user privacy.\n\nTo keep your Google Account active, all you need to do is sign in at least once every two years. You can do this by using any of Google's products or services, such as Gmail, Drive, or YouTube.\n\nIf you're worried about forgetting to sign in to your Google Account, you can set up an Inactive Account Manager. This feature allows you to choose what happens to your account if it becomes inactive.

This includes any photos, videos, documents, or other files that you have stored in your Google Account. You can download your data using Google Takeout.\n\n- Transfer any important information or data to another account. For example, if you use your Google Account to sign in to other websites or apps, you'll need to transfer your login information to another account.\n\n- Cancel any subscriptions or services that are associated with your Google Account. This includes things like Google Play subscriptions, YouTube Premium, and Google One.\n\n- Notify your contacts that your email address is changing. If you use your Google Account for email, you'll need to let your contacts know that your email address is changing.\n\n- Update your online accounts to use a different email address. If you use your Google Account to sign in to other online accounts, such as social media accounts or bank accounts, you'll need to update your login information to use a different email address.\n\nOnce you've taken care of all of the above, you can sign in to your Google Account to keep it active.\n\n### Here are some additional tips for keeping your Google Account active:\n\n#### Use Google products and services regularly. This includes things like Gmail, Drive, and YouTube.\n\n#### Set up an Inactive Account Manager.\n\nThis feature allows you to choose what happens to your account if it becomes inactive. For example, you can choose to have your data deleted, or you can choose to have it shared with a trusted contact.\n\n#### Make sure that your Google Account is secure.\n\nThis includes using a strong password and enabling two-factor authentication.\n\nBy following these tips, you can keep your Google Account active and avoid having it deleted.\n",

          "raw": "\nIn today's rapidly evolving world of web development, choosing the right API architecture is crucial for the success of your project. Traditionally, Representational State Transfer (REST) APIs have been the go-to choice for many developers, but GraphQL has emerged as a powerful alternative. In this article, we will delve into the advantages of GraphQL and why it may be the better option for your project.\n\n### Understanding REST and GraphQL\n\nBefore we dive into the comparison, let's briefly define REST and GraphQL.\n\n### REST (Representational State Transfer):\n\nREST is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It uses a set of conventions, including using HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources represented as URLs. Each resource typically corresponds to an endpoint, making it easy to understand and implement.\n\n### GraphQL:\n\nGraphQL, on the other hand, is a query language for your API and a runtime for executing those queries by your server. Unlike REST, where the server dictates the structure of the response, GraphQL allows clients to specify exactly what data they need, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching of data. Clients can request multiple resources in a single query, and the response matches the structure of the query.\n\n### Efficient Data Fetching:\n\nGraphQL allows clients to fetch only the data they need. In a REST API, you might have to make multiple requests to various endpoints to gather the required data, leading to over-fetching. GraphQL queries reduce this overhead by letting clients specify their data needs in a single request.\n\n### Versioning is Easier:\n\nIn REST, versioning is often handled by creating new endpoints or introducing version numbers in the URL. With GraphQL, you can evolve your schema without breaking existing clients. Clients request only the fields they are designed to handle, allowing for seamless updates.\n\n### Reduced Round Trips:\n\nIn REST, multiple requests are often required to fetch related data, which can lead to a high number of round trips. GraphQL allows you to fetch related data in one query, reducing the number of network requests, leading to faster and more efficient data retrieval.\n\n### Strongly Typed Schema:\n\nGraphQL uses a strongly typed schema, which defines the types of data available and how they relate to each other. This schema serves as a contract between clients and the server, making it easier to understand and maintain the API.\n\n### Real-time Capabilities:\n\nGraphQL is well-suited for real-time applications. With technologies like subscriptions, you can receive updates whenever data changes, making it ideal for chat applications, live notifications, and collaborative tools.\n\n### Simplicity:\n\nREST's simplicity is one of its strengths. It's easy to understand and implement, which makes it a good choice for simple projects or when a more traditional approach is preferred.\n\n### Caching:\n\nREST APIs can take advantage of HTTP caching, which can improve performance and reduce server load for frequently requested resources.\n\n### Standardization:\n\nREST has been around for a long time and is widely adopted, making it a standard choice for many web applications. This can simplify integration with third-party services and libraries.\n\n### Choosing the Right API for Your Project\n\nThe choice between GraphQL and REST depends on your project's specific requirements. Here are some considerations:\n\n### - Project Complexity:\n\nFor simple projects with well-defined endpoints, REST might be more straightforward. GraphQL is often a better fit for complex projects with dynamic data requirements.\n\n### - Mobile Applications:\n\nGraphQL can be more efficient for mobile apps, as it allows them to fetch only the required data and reduce data transfer, which can be crucial for improving app performance and reducing data usage.\n\n### - Third-party Integrations:\n\nIf you need to integrate with many third-party services or libraries that expect RESTful endpoints, REST might be a better choice due to its standardization.\n\n### - Real-time Requirements:\n\nIf your project relies heavily on real-time data updates, such as chat applications or live dashboards, GraphQL's subscription capabilities make it a strong contender.\n\n### - Team Expertise:\n\nConsider the expertise of your development team. If your team is already familiar with REST and there's no immediate need for the advantages of GraphQL, it might be more efficient to stick with REST.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n> Both GraphQL and REST have their strengths and can be suitable for different project requirements. The choice between the two should be made after a careful evaluation of your project's specific needs and constraints. As the technology landscape continues to evolve, GraphQL's flexibility and efficiency make it a compelling choice for many modern applications. However, in some cases, REST may still be the preferred option. Ultimately, the decision should align with your project's goals, scalability, and the expertise of your development team.\n",

          "raw": "\nCertainly! Let's provide a comprehensive comparison of three popular JavaScript frameworks: Angular, React, and Vue.js, including their strengths, weaknesses, and ideal use cases.\n\n#### Angular:\n\n### Strengths:\n\n**Comprehensive Framework:** Angular is a complete and opinionated framework, offering everything you need for building complex web applications, including routing, form handling, dependency injection, and a comprehensive set of tools.\n\n**TypeScript:** Angular is written in TypeScript, which provides static typing, improved tooling, and better code quality. It helps catch errors during development.\n\n**Two-Way Data Binding:** Angular provides two-way data binding, making it easy to keep the model and the view in sync.\n\n**Active Ecosystem:** Angular has a mature ecosystem with a large community, extensive official documentation, and a wide range of third-party libraries and packages.\n\n**Enterprise-Ready:** Angular is a popular choice for enterprise-level projects due to its architecture and tools for scalability and maintainability.\n\n### Weaknesses:\n\n**Complex Learning Curve:** The framework's comprehensive nature can result in a steep learning curve, particularly for developers new to Angular.\n\n**Verbose Code:** Angular applications often require more code compared to other frameworks, which can increase development time.\n\n### Use Cases:\n\nAngular is an excellent choice for large and complex applications, enterprise-level projects, and scenarios where strong typing and two-way data binding are essential. It's particularly well-suited for applications where maintainability and scalability are critical.\n\n#### React:\n\n### Strengths:\n\n**Component-Based:** React is renowned for its component-based architecture, which promotes reusability and modular development. This allows developers to build complex UIs by composing components.\n\n**Virtual DOM:** React employs a virtual DOM to efficiently update the actual DOM, resulting in excellent performance by reducing unnecessary DOM manipulations.\n\n**Flexibility:** React is not a complete framework but a library, offering developers flexibility to choose their preferred tools and libraries for routing, state management, and other aspects.\n\n**Large Ecosystem:** React boasts a vast ecosystem with numerous third-party libraries and a thriving community.\n\n### Weaknesses:\n\n**Learning Curve:** While React itself is relatively easy to learn, setting up the development environment and choosing the right libraries can be daunting, especially for beginners.\n\n**Boilerplate Code:** React's lack of opinionation means developers often have to make choices and write boilerplate code for common tasks.\n\n### Use Cases:\n\nReact is well-suited for building interactive, dynamic, and high-performance user interfaces. It's an ideal choice for single-page applications, e-commerce websites, and projects that require a high degree of customization.\n\n#### Vue.js:\n\n### Strengths:\n\n**Approachable:** Vue.js is praised for its gentle learning curve, making it an excellent choice for both beginners and experienced developers. It features clear and concise documentation.\n**Reactivity:** Vue.js offers a reactivity system that makes it easy to track and update changes in data, resulting in responsive user interfaces.\n**Single-File Components:** Vue allows developers to define components, templates, and CSS in a single file, which enhances organization and maintainability.\n**Lightweight:** Vue.js is lightweight and can be easily integrated into existing projects or progressively adopted.\n\n### Weaknesses:\n\n**Smaller Ecosystem:** While Vue.js has a growing community and ecosystem, it may not have as many pre-built solutions or third-party libraries as Angular or React.\n\n**Maturity:** Vue.js, while increasingly popular, is still considered newer compared to Angular and React.\n\n### Use Cases:\n\nVue.js is an excellent choice for small to medium-sized applications, projects with an emphasis on rapid development, and when you need a framework that's straightforward and easy to pick up.\n\n> In conclusion, the choice between Angular, React, and Vue.js should depend on your project's specific requirements and your development team's expertise. Angular is suitable for large and complex applications, React excels in building interactive and high-performance user interfaces, and Vue.js is an ideal choice for projects with a focus on simplicity and ease of use. Consider factors such as project size, complexity, and the existing skill set of your team when making your decision.\n\n\n\n\n",

          "raw": "\nGeForce RTX and NVIDIA RTX GPUs\n\nGenerative AI is one of the most important trends in the history of personal computing, bringing advancements to gaming, creativity, video, productivity, development and more.\n\nAnd GeForce RTX and NVIDIA RTX GPUs, which are packed with dedicated AI processors called Tensor Cores, are bringing the power of generative AI natively to more than 100 million Windows PCs and workstations.\n\nToday, generative AI on PC is getting up to 4x faster via TensorRT-LLM for Windows, an open-source library that accelerates inference performance for the latest AI large language models, like Llama 2 and Code Llama. This follows the announcement of TensorRT-LLM for data centers last month.\n\n### NVIDIA tools\n\nNVIDIA has also released tools to help developers accelerate their LLMs, including scripts that optimize custom models with TensorRT-LLM, TensorRT-optimized open-source models and a developer reference project that showcases both the speed and quality of LLM responses.\n\nTensorRT acceleration is now available for Stable Diffusion in the popular Web UI by Automatic1111 distribution. It speeds up the generative AI diffusion model by up to 2x over the previous fastest implementation.\n\nPlus, RTX Video Super Resolution (VSR) version 1.5 is available as part of today’s Game Ready Driver release — and will be available in the next NVIDIA Studio Driver, releasing early next month.\n\n### Supercharging LLMs With TensorRT\n\nLLMs are fueling productivity — engaging in chat, summarizing documents and web content, drafting emails and blogs — and are at the core of new pipelines of AI and other software that can automatically analyze data and generate a vast array of content.\n\n### TensorRT-LLM\n\nTensorRT-LLM, a library for accelerating LLM inference, gives developers and end users the benefit of LLMs that can now operate up to 4x faster on RTX-powered Windows PCs.\n\nAt higher batch sizes, this acceleration significantly improves the experience for more sophisticated LLM use — like writing and coding assistants that output multiple, unique auto-complete results at once. The result is accelerated performance and improved quality that lets users select the best of the bunch.\n\n### TensorRT-LLM\n\nTensorRT-LLM acceleration is also beneficial when integrating LLM capabilities with other technology, such as in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), where an LLM is paired with a vector library or vector database. RAG enables the LLM to deliver responses based on a specific dataset, like user emails or articles on a website, to provide more targeted answers.\n\n### How does NVIDIA ACE\n\nTo show this in practical terms, when the question “How does NVIDIA ACE generate emotional responses?” was asked of the LLaMa 2 base model, it returned an unhelpful response.\n\nConversely, using RAG with recent GeForce news articles loaded into a vector library and connected to the same Llama 2 model not only returned the correct answer — using NeMo SteerLM — but did so much quicker with TensorRT-LLM acceleration. This combination of speed and proficiency gives users smarter solutions.\n\nTensorRT-LLM will soon be available to download from the NVIDIA Developer website. TensorRT-optimized open source models and the RAG demo with GeForce news as a sample project are available at ngc.nvidia.com and GitHub.com/NVIDIA.\n\n### Automatic Acceleration\n\nDiffusion models, like Stable Diffusion, are used to imagine and create stunning, novel works of art. Image generation is an iterative process that can take hundreds of cycles to achieve the perfect output. When done on an underpowered computer, this iteration can add up to hours of wait time.\n\n### TensorRT\n\nTensorRT is designed to accelerate AI models through layer fusion, precision calibration, kernel auto-tuning and other capabilities that significantly boost inference efficiency and speed. This makes it indispensable for real-time applications and resource-intensive tasks.\n\nAnd now, TensorRT doubles the speed of Stable Diffusion.\n\n### WebUI\n\nCompatible with the most popular distribution, WebUI from Automatic1111, Stable Diffusion with TensorRT acceleration helps users iterate faster and spend less time waiting on the computer, delivering a final image sooner. On a GeForce RTX 4090, it runs 7x faster than the top implementation on Macs with an Apple M2 Ultra. The extension is available for download today.\n\nThe TensorRT demo of a Stable Diffusion pipeline provides developers with a reference implementation on how to prepare diffusion models and accelerate them using TensorRT. This is the starting point for developers interested in turbocharging a diffusion pipeline and bringing lightning-fast inferencing to applications.\n\n### Video That’s Super\n\nAI is improving everyday PC experiences for all users. Streaming video — from nearly any source, like YouTube, Twitch, Prime Video, Disney+ and countless others — is among the most popular activities on a PC. Thanks to AI and RTX, it’s getting another update in image quality.\n\nRTX VSR is a breakthrough in AI pixel processing that improves the quality of streamed video content by reducing or eliminating artifacts caused by video compression. It also sharpens edges and details.\n\n### Video sample\n\nAvailable now, RTX VSR version 1.5 further improves visual quality with updated models, de-artifacts content played in its native resolution and adds support for RTX GPUs based on the NVIDIA Turing architecture — both professional RTX and GeForce RTX 20 Series GPUs.\n\nRetraining the VSR AI model helped it learn to accurately identify the difference between subtle details and compression artifacts. As a result, AI-enhanced images more accurately preserve details during the upscaling process. Finer details are more visible, and the overall image looks sharper and crisper.\n\nNew with version 1.5 is the ability to de-artifact video played at the display’s native resolution. The original release only enhanced video when it was being upscaled. Now, for example, 1080p video streamed to a 1080p resolution display will look smoother as heavy artifacts are reduced.\n\nRTX VSR 1.5 is available today for all RTX users in the latest Game Ready Driver. It will be available in the upcoming NVIDIA Studio Driver, scheduled for early next month.\n\nRTX VSR is among the NVIDIA software, tools, libraries and SDKs — like those mentioned above, plus DLSS, Omniverse, AI Workbench and others — that have helped bring over 400 AI-enabled apps and games to consumers.\n\nThe AI era is upon us. And RTX is supercharging at every step in its evolution.\n",

          "raw": "\n\n\nUntil now, trying to style an article, document, or blog post with Tailwind has been a tedious task that required a keen eye for typography and a lot of complex custom CSS.\n\nBy default, Tailwind removes all of the default browser styling from paragraphs, headings, lists and more. This ends up being really useful for building application UIs because you spend less time undoing user-agent styles, but when you _really are_ just trying to style some content that came from a rich-text editor in a CMS or a markdown file, it can be surprising and unintuitive.\n\nWe get lots of complaints about it actually, with people regularly asking us things like:\n\n> Why is Tailwind removing the default styles on my `h1` elements? How do I disable this? What do you mean I lose all the other base styles too?\n> We hear you, but we're not convinced that simply disabling our base styles is what you really want. You don't want to have to remove annoying margins every time you use a `p` element in a piece of your dashboard UI. And I doubt you really want your blog posts to use the user-agent styles either — you want them to look _awesome_, not awful.\n\nThe `@tailwindcss/typography` plugin is our attempt to give you what you _actually_ want, without any of the downsides of doing something stupid like disabling our base styles.\n\nIt adds a new `prose` class that you can slap on any block of vanilla HTML content and turn it into a beautiful, well-formatted document:\n\n```html\n<article className=\"prose\">\n  <h1>Garlic bread with cheese: What the science tells us</h1>\n  <p>\n    For years parents have espoused the health benefits of eating garlic bread\n    with cheese to their children, with the food earning such an iconic status\n    in our culture that kids will often dress up as warm, cheesy loaf for\n    Halloween.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    But a recent study shows that the celebrated appetizer may be linked to a\n    series of rabies cases springing up around the country.\n  </p>\n</article>\n```\n\nFor more information about how to use the plugin and the features it includes, [read the documentation](https://github.com/tailwindcss/typography/blob/master/README.md).\n\n---\n\n## What to expect from here on out\n\nWhat follows from here is just a bunch of absolute nonsense I've written to dogfood the plugin itself. It includes every sensible typographic element I could think of, like **bold text**, unordered lists, ordered lists, code blocks, block quotes, _and even italics_.\n\nIt's important to cover all of these use cases for a few reasons:\n\n1.  We want everything to look good out of the box.\n2.  Really just the first reason, that's the whole point of the plugin.\n3.  Here's a third pretend reason though a list with three items looks more realistic than a list with two items.\n\nNow we're going to try out another header style.\n\n### Typography should be easy\n\nSo that's a header for you — with any luck if we've done our job correctly that will look pretty reasonable.\n\nSomething a wise person once told me about typography is:\n\n> Typography is pretty important if you don't want your stuff to look like trash. Make it good then it won't be bad.\n\nIt's probably important that images look okay here by default as well:\n\n<Image\n  src=\"/blogs/c-d-x-PDX_a_82obo-unsplash.jpg\"\n  width=\"718\"\n  height=\"404\"\n  alt=\"Image\"\n  sizes=\"100vw\"\n/>\n\nContrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old.\n\nNow I'm going to show you an example of an unordered list to make sure that looks good, too:\n\n- So here is the first item in this list.\n- In this example we're keeping the items short.\n- Later, we'll use longer, more complex list items.\n\nAnd that's the end of this section.\n\n## What if we stack headings?\n\n### We should make sure that looks good, too.\n\nSometimes you have headings directly underneath each other. In those cases you often have to undo the top margin on the second heading because it usually looks better for the headings to be closer together than a paragraph followed by a heading should be.\n\n### When a heading comes after a paragraph …\n\nWhen a heading comes after a paragraph, we need a bit more space, like I already mentioned above. Now let's see what a more complex list would look like.\n\n- **I often do this thing where list items have headings.**\n\n  For some reason I think this looks cool which is unfortunate because it's pretty annoying to get the styles right.\n\n  I often have two or three paragraphs in these list items, too, so the hard part is getting the spacing between the paragraphs, list item heading, and separate list items to all make sense. Pretty tough honestly, you could make a strong argument that you just shouldn't write this way.\n\n- **Since this is a list, I need at least two items.**\n\n  I explained what I'm doing already in the previous list item, but a list wouldn't be a list if it only had one item, and we really want this to look realistic. That's why I've added this second list item so I actually have something to look at when writing the styles.\n\n- **It's not a bad idea to add a third item either.**\n\n  I think it probably would've been fine to just use two items but three is definitely not worse, and since I seem to be having no trouble making up arbitrary things to type, I might as well include it.\n\nAfter this sort of list I usually have a closing statement or paragraph, because it kinda looks weird jumping right to a heading.\n\n## Code should look okay by default.\n\nI think most people are going to use [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) or [Prism](https://prismjs.com/) or something if they want to style their code blocks but it wouldn't hurt to make them look _okay_ out of the box, even with no syntax highlighting.\n\nHere's what a default `tailwind.config.js` file looks like at the time of writing:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  purge: [],\n  theme: {\n    extend: {},\n  },\n  variants: {},\n  plugins: [],\n}\n```\n\nHopefully that looks good enough to you.\n\n### What about nested lists?\n\nNested lists basically always look bad which is why editors like Medium don't even let you do it, but I guess since some of you goofballs are going to do it we have to carry the burden of at least making it work.\n\n1.  **Nested lists are rarely a good idea.**\n    - You might feel like you are being really \"organized\" or something but you are just creating a gross shape on the screen that is hard to read.\n    - Nested navigation in UIs is a bad idea too, keep things as flat as possible.\n    - Nesting tons of folders in your source code is also not helpful.\n2.  **Since we need to have more items, here's another one.**\n    - I'm not sure if we'll bother styling more than two levels deep.\n    - Two is already too much, three is guaranteed to be a bad idea.\n    - If you nest four levels deep you belong in prison.\n3.  **Two items isn't really a list, three is good though.**\n    - Again please don't nest lists if you want people to actually read your content.\n    - Nobody wants to look at this.\n    - I'm upset that we even have to bother styling this.\n\nThe most annoying thing about lists in Markdown is that `<li>` elements aren't given a child `<p>` tag unless there are multiple paragraphs in the list item. That means I have to worry about styling that annoying situation too.\n\n- **For example, here's another nested list.**\n\n  But this time with a second paragraph.\n\n  - These list items won't have `<p>` tags\n  - Because they are only one line each\n\n- **But in this second top-level list item, they will.**\n\n  This is especially annoying because of the spacing on this paragraph.\n\n  - As you can see here, because I've added a second line, this list item now has a `<p>` tag.\n\n    This is the second line I'm talking about by the way.\n\n  - Finally here's another list item so it's more like a list.\n\n- A closing list item, but with no nested list, because why not?\n\nAnd finally a sentence to close off this section.\n\n## There are other elements we need to style\n\nI almost forgot to mention links, like [this link to the Tailwind CSS website](https://tailwindcss.com). We almost made them blue but that's so yesterday, so we went with dark gray, feels edgier.\n\nWe even included table styles, check it out:\n\n| Wrestler                | Origin       | Finisher           |\n| ----------------------- | ------------ | ------------------ |\n| Bret \"The Hitman\" Hart  | Calgary, AB  | Sharpshooter       |\n| Stone Cold Steve Austin | Austin, TX   | Stone Cold Stunner |\n| Randy Savage            | Sarasota, FL | Elbow Drop         |\n| Vader                   | Boulder, CO  | Vader Bomb         |\n| Razor Ramon             | Chuluota, FL | Razor's Edge       |\n\nWe also need to make sure inline code looks good, like if I wanted to talk about `<span>` elements or tell you the good news about `@tailwindcss/typography`.\n\n### Sometimes I even use `code` in headings\n\nEven though it's probably a bad idea, and historically I've had a hard time making it look good. This _\"wrap the code blocks in backticks\"_ trick works pretty well though really.\n\nAnother thing I've done in the past is put a `code` tag inside of a link, like if I wanted to tell you about the [`tailwindcss/docs`](https://github.com/tailwindcss/docs) repository. I don't love that there is an underline below the backticks but it is absolutely not worth the madness it would require to avoid it.\n\n#### We haven't used an `h4` yet\n\nBut now we have. Please don't use `h5` or `h6` in your content, Medium only supports two heading levels for a reason, you animals. I honestly considered using a `before` pseudo-element to scream at you if you use an `h5` or `h6`.\n\nWe don't style them at all out of the box because `h4` elements are already so small that they are the same size as the body copy. What are we supposed to do with an `h5`, make it _smaller_ than the body copy? No thanks.\n\n### We still need to think about stacked headings though.\n\n#### Let's make sure we don't screw that up with `h4` elements, either.\n\nPhew, with any luck we have styled the headings above this text and they look pretty good.\n\nLet's add a closing paragraph here so things end with a decently sized block of text. I can't explain why I want things to end that way but I have to assume it's because I think things will look weird or unbalanced if there is a heading too close to the end of the document.\n\nWhat I've written here is probably long enough, but adding this final sentence can't hurt.\n\n## GitHub Flavored Markdown\n\nI've also added support for GitHub Flavored Mardown using `remark-gfm`.\n\nWith `remark-gfm`, we get a few extra features in our markdown. Example: autolink literals.\n\nA link like www.example.com or https://example.com would automatically be converted into an `a` tag.\n\nThis works for email links too: contact@example.com.",

          "raw": "\nA Game-Changing Move in the World of Gaming\n\n### Introduction\n\nIn a move that has sent shockwaves throughout the gaming industry, Microsoft has successfully completed its acquisition of Activision Blizzard. This monumental deal, worth a staggering $68.7 billion, has not only solidified Microsoft's position in the gaming world but has also brought major franchises like Call of Duty under the Xbox umbrella. This acquisition is set to reshape the landscape of the gaming industry and has left fans and industry experts buzzing with excitement. Let's delve into the details of this historic deal and explore the potential implications for the future of gaming.\n\n### The Mega Deal\n\nMicrosoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard, which was officially completed on [Date], is one of the largest deals in the history of the gaming industry. The acquisition grants Microsoft control over a vast array of renowned franchises, including Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, Overwatch, and many more. The move also puts Microsoft in a position to compete more directly with gaming giants like Sony and Nintendo.\n\n### Why Call of Duty Matters\n\nAmong all the assets acquired, the inclusion of Call of Duty is particularly significant. Call of Duty, a franchise with an illustrious history spanning nearly two decades, has a massive and dedicated fan base. With titles that have consistently topped the sales charts and dominated the esports scene, it's one of the most influential gaming franchises in the world. The inclusion of Call of Duty in the Xbox ecosystem could mark a turning point in the console wars.\n\n### The Xbox Ecosystem Expansion\n\nMicrosoft's acquisition is poised to strengthen the Xbox ecosystem significantly. The integration of Call of Duty into the Xbox Game Pass, which provides subscribers with access to a vast library of games, is one of the most anticipated developments. This move is expected to drive a surge in Xbox Game Pass subscriptions and cement the platform's place as the go-to destination for gaming enthusiasts.\n\n### Cross-Platform Play and Exclusivity\n\nThe acquisition has raised questions about whether Call of Duty titles will remain available on other platforms. Microsoft has affirmed its commitment to maintaining cross-platform play in some of its acquired titles. However, there may be certain exclusivity deals in the future, which could further differentiate the Xbox ecosystem.\n\n### Impact on Esports\n\nCall of Duty's involvement in esports is another dimension of this deal that has generated significant interest. Microsoft, through its Xbox brand, has been increasingly investing in esports, and this acquisition may bring about new opportunities for the competitive gaming scene. Fans of the Call of Duty League and other competitive gaming circuits are eager to see how this acquisition will influence the landscape.\n\n### Challenges and Regulatory Scrutiny\n\nOf course, a deal of this magnitude is not without its challenges. Regulatory scrutiny and concerns about potential monopolistic behavior have been raised. Microsoft has stated its commitment to upholding fair competition and has emphasized the importance of player choice in gaming. However, regulators will continue to monitor the situation closely.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n> Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard, with Call of Duty now part of Xbox, has set the stage for a new era in gaming. With a stronger Xbox ecosystem, potential exclusives, and cross-platform play, this deal could reshape how gamers experience their favorite titles. The impact of this acquisition on esports is another area to watch closely, as it could open doors to new opportunities for competitive gaming. Nevertheless, challenges and regulatory oversight will be an ongoing aspect of this massive consolidation.\n\n> As the gaming industry continues to evolve, this acquisition marks a significant milestone, and the ripples of its impact will be felt for years to come. Gamers, industry professionals, and investors will be watching closely to see how this acquisition unfolds and how it transforms the world of gaming.\n",

          "raw": "\n\n\nUntil now, trying to style an article, document, or blog post with Tailwind has been a tedious task that required a keen eye for typography and a lot of complex custom CSS.\n\nBy default, Tailwind removes all of the default browser styling from paragraphs, headings, lists and more. This ends up being really useful for building application UIs because you spend less time undoing user-agent styles, but when you _really are_ just trying to style some content that came from a rich-text editor in a CMS or a markdown file, it can be surprising and unintuitive.\n\nWe get lots of complaints about it actually, with people regularly asking us things like:\n\n> Why is Tailwind removing the default styles on my `h1` elements? How do I disable this? What do you mean I lose all the other base styles too?\n> We hear you, but we're not convinced that simply disabling our base styles is what you really want. You don't want to have to remove annoying margins every time you use a `p` element in a piece of your dashboard UI. And I doubt you really want your blog posts to use the user-agent styles either — you want them to look _awesome_, not awful.\n\nThe `@tailwindcss/typography` plugin is our attempt to give you what you _actually_ want, without any of the downsides of doing something stupid like disabling our base styles.\n\nIt adds a new `prose` class that you can slap on any block of vanilla HTML content and turn it into a beautiful, well-formatted document:\n\n```html\n<article className=\"prose\">\n  <h1>Garlic bread with cheese: What the science tells us</h1>\n  <p>\n    For years parents have espoused the health benefits of eating garlic bread\n    with cheese to their children, with the food earning such an iconic status\n    in our culture that kids will often dress up as warm, cheesy loaf for\n    Halloween.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    But a recent study shows that the celebrated appetizer may be linked to a\n    series of rabies cases springing up around the country.\n  </p>\n</article>\n```\n\nFor more information about how to use the plugin and the features it includes, [read the documentation](https://github.com/tailwindcss/typography/blob/master/README.md).\n\n---\n\n## What to expect from here on out\n\nWhat follows from here is just a bunch of absolute nonsense I've written to dogfood the plugin itself. It includes every sensible typographic element I could think of, like **bold text**, unordered lists, ordered lists, code blocks, block quotes, _and even italics_.\n\nIt's important to cover all of these use cases for a few reasons:\n\n1.  We want everything to look good out of the box.\n2.  Really just the first reason, that's the whole point of the plugin.\n3.  Here's a third pretend reason though a list with three items looks more realistic than a list with two items.\n\nNow we're going to try out another header style.\n\n### Typography should be easy\n\nSo that's a header for you — with any luck if we've done our job correctly that will look pretty reasonable.\n\nSomething a wise person once told me about typography is:\n\n> Typography is pretty important if you don't want your stuff to look like trash. Make it good then it won't be bad.\n\nIt's probably important that images look okay here by default as well:\n\n<Image\n  src=\"/blogs/c-d-x-PDX_a_82obo-unsplash.jpg\"\n  width=\"718\"\n  height=\"404\"\n  alt=\"Image\"\n  sizes=\"100vw\"\n/>\n\nContrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old.\n\nNow I'm going to show you an example of an unordered list to make sure that looks good, too:\n\n- So here is the first item in this list.\n- In this example we're keeping the items short.\n- Later, we'll use longer, more complex list items.\n\nAnd that's the end of this section.\n\n## What if we stack headings?\n\n### We should make sure that looks good, too.\n\nSometimes you have headings directly underneath each other. In those cases you often have to undo the top margin on the second heading because it usually looks better for the headings to be closer together than a paragraph followed by a heading should be.\n\n### When a heading comes after a paragraph …\n\nWhen a heading comes after a paragraph, we need a bit more space, like I already mentioned above. Now let's see what a more complex list would look like.\n\n- **I often do this thing where list items have headings.**\n\n  For some reason I think this looks cool which is unfortunate because it's pretty annoying to get the styles right.\n\n  I often have two or three paragraphs in these list items, too, so the hard part is getting the spacing between the paragraphs, list item heading, and separate list items to all make sense. Pretty tough honestly, you could make a strong argument that you just shouldn't write this way.\n\n- **Since this is a list, I need at least two items.**\n\n  I explained what I'm doing already in the previous list item, but a list wouldn't be a list if it only had one item, and we really want this to look realistic. That's why I've added this second list item so I actually have something to look at when writing the styles.\n\n- **It's not a bad idea to add a third item either.**\n\n  I think it probably would've been fine to just use two items but three is definitely not worse, and since I seem to be having no trouble making up arbitrary things to type, I might as well include it.\n\nAfter this sort of list I usually have a closing statement or paragraph, because it kinda looks weird jumping right to a heading.\n\n## Code should look okay by default.\n\nI think most people are going to use [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) or [Prism](https://prismjs.com/) or something if they want to style their code blocks but it wouldn't hurt to make them look _okay_ out of the box, even with no syntax highlighting.\n\nHere's what a default `tailwind.config.js` file looks like at the time of writing:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  purge: [],\n  theme: {\n    extend: {},\n  },\n  variants: {},\n  plugins: [],\n}\n```\n\nHopefully that looks good enough to you.\n\n### What about nested lists?\n\nNested lists basically always look bad which is why editors like Medium don't even let you do it, but I guess since some of you goofballs are going to do it we have to carry the burden of at least making it work.\n\n1.  **Nested lists are rarely a good idea.**\n    - You might feel like you are being really \"organized\" or something but you are just creating a gross shape on the screen that is hard to read.\n    - Nested navigation in UIs is a bad idea too, keep things as flat as possible.\n    - Nesting tons of folders in your source code is also not helpful.\n2.  **Since we need to have more items, here's another one.**\n    - I'm not sure if we'll bother styling more than two levels deep.\n    - Two is already too much, three is guaranteed to be a bad idea.\n    - If you nest four levels deep you belong in prison.\n3.  **Two items isn't really a list, three is good though.**\n    - Again please don't nest lists if you want people to actually read your content.\n    - Nobody wants to look at this.\n    - I'm upset that we even have to bother styling this.\n\nThe most annoying thing about lists in Markdown is that `<li>` elements aren't given a child `<p>` tag unless there are multiple paragraphs in the list item. That means I have to worry about styling that annoying situation too.\n\n- **For example, here's another nested list.**\n\n  But this time with a second paragraph.\n\n  - These list items won't have `<p>` tags\n  - Because they are only one line each\n\n- **But in this second top-level list item, they will.**\n\n  This is especially annoying because of the spacing on this paragraph.\n\n  - As you can see here, because I've added a second line, this list item now has a `<p>` tag.\n\n    This is the second line I'm talking about by the way.\n\n  - Finally here's another list item so it's more like a list.\n\n- A closing list item, but with no nested list, because why not?\n\nAnd finally a sentence to close off this section.\n\n## There are other elements we need to style\n\nI almost forgot to mention links, like [this link to the Tailwind CSS website](https://tailwindcss.com). We almost made them blue but that's so yesterday, so we went with dark gray, feels edgier.\n\nWe even included table styles, check it out:\n\n| Wrestler                | Origin       | Finisher           |\n| ----------------------- | ------------ | ------------------ |\n| Bret \"The Hitman\" Hart  | Calgary, AB  | Sharpshooter       |\n| Stone Cold Steve Austin | Austin, TX   | Stone Cold Stunner |\n| Randy Savage            | Sarasota, FL | Elbow Drop         |\n| Vader                   | Boulder, CO  | Vader Bomb         |\n| Razor Ramon             | Chuluota, FL | Razor's Edge       |\n\nWe also need to make sure inline code looks good, like if I wanted to talk about `<span>` elements or tell you the good news about `@tailwindcss/typography`.\n\n### Sometimes I even use `code` in headings\n\nEven though it's probably a bad idea, and historically I've had a hard time making it look good. This _\"wrap the code blocks in backticks\"_ trick works pretty well though really.\n\nAnother thing I've done in the past is put a `code` tag inside of a link, like if I wanted to tell you about the [`tailwindcss/docs`](https://github.com/tailwindcss/docs) repository. I don't love that there is an underline below the backticks but it is absolutely not worth the madness it would require to avoid it.\n\n#### We haven't used an `h4` yet\n\nBut now we have. Please don't use `h5` or `h6` in your content, Medium only supports two heading levels for a reason, you animals. I honestly considered using a `before` pseudo-element to scream at you if you use an `h5` or `h6`.\n\nWe don't style them at all out of the box because `h4` elements are already so small that they are the same size as the body copy. What are we supposed to do with an `h5`, make it _smaller_ than the body copy? No thanks.\n\n### We still need to think about stacked headings though.\n\n#### Let's make sure we don't screw that up with `h4` elements, either.\n\nPhew, with any luck we have styled the headings above this text and they look pretty good.\n\nLet's add a closing paragraph here so things end with a decently sized block of text. I can't explain why I want things to end that way but I have to assume it's because I think things will look weird or unbalanced if there is a heading too close to the end of the document.\n\nWhat I've written here is probably long enough, but adding this final sentence can't hurt.\n\n## GitHub Flavored Markdown\n\nI've also added support for GitHub Flavored Mardown using `remark-gfm`.\n\nWith `remark-gfm`, we get a few extra features in our markdown.

They provide a standardized approach to designing and interacting with web services, enabling seamless communication between different software systems over the internet. In this article, we'll explore the fundamental concepts of RESTful APIs, their key components, and their significance in building robust and scalable web applications.\n\n### What is RESTful API?\n\n- **REST (Representational State Transfer):** A software architectural style that defines a set of constraints for designing networked applications.\n\n- **API (Application Programming Interface):** A set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other.\n\n### Key Concepts of RESTful APIs:\n\n- **Resources:** In REST, everything is treated as a resource, such as data objects or services, and each resource is uniquely identified by a URL (Uniform Resource Locator).\n\n- **HTTP Methods:** RESTful APIs use standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and more to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources.\n\n- **Stateless:** REST APIs are stateless, meaning that each request from a client to the server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request, with no dependency on previous requests.\n\n### URL Structure:\n\n##### RESTful APIs use a hierarchical URL structure to identify resources. For example:\n\n- GET /api/products: Retrieve a list of products.\n\n- POST /api/products: Create a new product.\n\n- GET /api/products/123: Retrieve a specific product with ID 123.\n\n### Data Formats:\n\n- RESTful APIs commonly use JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) or XML (eXtensible Markup Language) for data interchange between the client and server.\n\n### Status Codes:\n\n- HTTP status codes (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found) are used to indicate the outcome of API requests, making it easier to handle errors and responses.\n\n### Authentication and Authorization:\n\n- RESTful APIs often require authentication mechanisms (e.g., API keys, OAuth tokens) to secure access to protected resources.\n\n- Authorization ensures that clients have the appropriate permissions to perform certain actions on resources.\n\n### Benefits of RESTful APIs:\n\n- **Simplicity:** RESTful APIs are easy to understand and implement, making them a popular choice for web services.\n\n- **Scalability:** They allow for scalable architecture, with resources distributed across multiple servers.\n\n- **Interoperability:** REST works well with different programming languages and platforms, promoting interoperability.\n\n- **Statelessness:** Statelessness simplifies server management and enhances reliability.\n\n### Use Cases:\n\nRESTful APIs are widely used in various domains, including e-commerce, social media, IoT (Internet of Things), and mobile app development.\n\n> RESTful APIs serve as the backbone of modern web applications, enabling seamless communication and data exchange between clients and servers. Understanding the principles and best practices of RESTful API design is essential for developers building robust and scalable web services. With their simplicity, scalability, and interoperability, RESTful APIs continue to be a fundamental technology in the world of web development.\n\n### Sample code on how to implement a RESTful API using JavaScript\n\nCreating a RESTful API using JavaScript typically involves building a server that listens for incoming HTTP requests, processes those requests, interacts with a database or data source, and sends back appropriate HTTP responses. Here are step-by-step instructions on how to implement a basic RESTful API using JavaScript and Node.js:\n\n- **Step 1:** Set Up Your Environment\nBefore you begin, make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from the official Node.js website (https://nodejs.org/).\n\n- **Step 2:** Create a Project Directory\nCreate a new directory for your RESTful API project and navigate to it in your terminal:\n\n\nStep 3: Initialize a Node.js Project\nInitialize a new Node.js project by running the following command:\n\nnpm init -y\n\nThis will create a package.json file that keeps track of your project's dependencies.\n\n### Step 4: Install Dependencies\n\nYou'll need a few dependencies for building the API. Install Express, a popular Node.js framework for building web applications:\n\nnpm install express\n\nYou may also want to install other packages like body-parser for handling request bodies and nodemon for automatic server restarts during development:\n\nnpm install body-parser nodemon\n\n### Step 5: Create the Server\n\nCreate a JavaScript file (e.g., server.js) in your project directory to define your server:\n\n```javascript\nconst express = require('express');\nconst bodyParser = require('body-parser');\n\nconst app = express();\nconst port = 3000; // You can choose any port you like\n\napp.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }));\napp.use(bodyParser.json());\n\napp.listen(port, () => {\n  console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);\n});\n```\n\n\n\nStep 7: Start the Server\n\nFinally, start your server using nodemon (or simply node server.js if you prefer):\n\nnodemon server.js\n\nYour RESTful API is now running and listening for requests on http://localhost:3000. You can use tools like Postman or curl to test your API endpoints.\n\nThis is a basic example of creating a RESTful API using JavaScript and Node.js. Depending on your project's requirements, you may need to integrate a database, add authentication, and implement more complex business logic.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "raw": "\nProducts built on top of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's ChatGPT and Anthropic's Claude are brilliant yet flawed. Powerful as they are, current LLMs suffer from several drawbacks: Please check out this [Article](https://www.otofastproject.com/blogs/unveiling-the-futureof-ai-introducing-voyage-embeddings) for further understanding.\n\n- They are static - LLMs are “frozen in time” and lack up-to-date information. It is not feasible to update their gigantic training datasets.\n- They lack domain-specific knowledge - LLMs are trained for generalized tasks, meaning they do not know your company’s private data.\n- They function as “black boxes” - it’s not easy to understand which sources an LLM was considering when they arrived at their conclusions.\n- They are inefficient and costly to produce - Few organizations have the financial and human resources to produce and deploy foundation models.\n\n> Unfortunately, these issues affect the accuracy of GenAI applications leveraging LLMs. For any business application with requirements more demanding than your average chatbot demo, LLMs used “out of the box” with no modifications aside from prompting will perform poorly at context-dependent tasks, such as helping customers book their next flight.\n\nThis post will examine why Retrieval Augmented Generation is the preferred method for addressing these drawbacks, provide a deep dive into how RAG works, and explain why most companies use RAG to boost their GenAI applications’ performance.\n\n### LLMs are “stuck” at a particular time, but RAG can bring them into the present.\n\nChatGPT’s training data “cutoff point” was September 2021. If you ask ChatGPT about something that occurred last month, it will not only fail to answer your question factually; it will likely dream up a very convincing-sounding outright lie. We commonly refer to this behavior as “hallucination.”\n\nLLMs frequently hallucinate when asked about context not within their training dataset\nThe LLM lacks domain-specific information about the Volvo XC60 in the above example. Although the LLM has no idea how to turn off reverse braking for that car model, it performs its generative task to the best of its ability anyway, producing an answer that sounds grammatically solid - but is unfortunately flatly incorrect.\n\nThe reason LLMs like ChatGPT feel so bright is that they've seen an immense amount of human creative output - entire companies’ worth of open source code, libraries worth of books, lifetimes of conversations, scientific datasets, etc., but, critically, this core training data is static.\n\nAfter OpenAI finished training the foundation model (FM) behind ChatGPT in 2021, it received no additional updated information about the world; it remains oblivious to significant world events, weather systems, new laws, the outcomes of sporting events, and, as demonstrated in the image above, the operating procedures for the latest automobiles.\n\n### RAG provides up-to-date information about the world and domain-specific data to your GenAI applications.\n\nRetrieval Augmented Generation means fetching up-to-date or context-specific data from an external database and making it available to an LLM when asking it to generate a response, solving this problem. You can store proprietary business data or information about the world and have your application fetch it for the LLM at generation time, reducing the likelihood of hallucinations. The result is a noticeable boost in the performance and accuracy of your GenAI application.\n\n### LLMs lack context from private data - leading to hallucinations when asked domain or company-specific questions.\n\nThe second major drawback of current LLMs is that, although their base corpus of knowledge is impressive, they do not know the specifics of your business, your requirements, your customer base, or the context your application is running in - such as your e-commerce store.\n\nRAG addresses this second issue by providing extra context and factual information to your GenAI application’s LLM at generation time: anything from customer records to paragraphs of dialogue in a play, to product specifications and current stock, to audio such as voice or songs. The LLM uses this provided content to generate an informed answer.\n\n### Retrieval Augmented Generation allows GenAI to cite its sources and improves auditability.\n\nIn addition to addressing the recency and domain-specific data issues, RAG also allows GenAI applications to provide their sources, much like research papers will provide citations for where they obtained an essential piece of data used in their findings.\n\nImagine a GenAI application serving the legal industry by helping lawyers prepare arguments. The GenAI application will ultimately present its recommendations as final outputs. Still, RAG enables it to provide citations of the legal precedents, local laws, and the evidence it used when arriving at its proposals.\n\nRAG makes the inner workings of GenAI applications easier to audit and understand. It allows end users to jump straight into the same source documents the LLM used when creating its answers.\n\n### Why is RAG the preferred approach from a cost-efficacy perspective?\n\nThere are three main options for improving the performance of your GenAI application other than RAG. Let’s examine them to understand why RAG remains the main path most companies take today.\n\n#### Create your own foundation model\n\nOpenAI’s Sam Altman estimated it cost around $100 million to train the foundation model behind ChatGPT.\n\nNot every company or model will require such a significant investment, but ChatGPT’s price tag underscores that cost is a real challenge in producing sophisticated models with today’s techniques.\n\nIn addition to raw compute costs, you’ll also face the scarce talent issue: you need specialized teams of machine learning PhDs, top-notch systems engineers, and highly skilled operations folks to tackle the many technical challenges of producing such a model and every other AI company in the world is angling for the same rare talent.\n\nAnother challenge is obtaining, sanitizing, and labeling the datasets required to produce a capable foundation model. For example, suppose you’re a legal discovery company considering training your model to answer questions about legal documents. In that case, you’ll also need legal experts to spend many hours labeling training data.\n\nEven if you have access to sufficient capital, can assemble the right team, obtain and label adequate datasets and overcome the many technical hurdles to hosting your model in production, there’s no guarantee of success. The industry has seen several ambitious AI startups come and go, and we expect to see more failures.\n\n#### Fine-tuning: adapting a foundation model to your domain’s data.\n\nFine-tuning is the process of retraining a foundation model on new data. It can certainly be cheaper than building a foundation model from scratch. Still, this approach suffers from many of the same downsides of creating a foundation model: you need rare and deep expertise and sufficient data, and the costs and technical complexity of hosting your model in production don’t go away.\n\nFine-tuning is not a practical approach now that LLMs are pairable with vector databases for context retrieval. Some LLM providers, such as OpenAI, no longer support fine-tuning for their latest-generation models.\n\nFine-tuning is an outdated method of improving LLM outputs. It required recurring, costly, and time-intensive labeling work by subject-matter experts and constant monitoring for quality drift, undesirable deviations in the accuracy of a model due to a lack of regular updates, or changes in data distribution.\n\nIf your data changes over time, even a fine-tuned model’s accuracy can drop, requiring more costly and time-intensive data labeling, constant quality monitoring, and repeated fine-tuning.\n\nImagine updating your model every time you sell a car so your GenAI application has the most recent inventory data.\n\n#### Prompt engineering is insufficient for reducing hallucinations.\n\nPrompt engineering means testing and tweaking the instructions you provide your model to attempt to coax it to do what you want.\n\nIt’s also the cheapest option to improve the accuracy of your GenAI application because you can quickly update the instructions provided to your GenAI application’s LLM with a few code changes.\n\nIt refines the responses your LLMs return but cannot provide them with any new or dynamic context, so your GenAI application will still lack up-to-date context and be susceptible to hallucination.\n\n#### Let’s now take a deeper dive into how Retrieval Augmented Generation works.\n\nWe’ve discussed how RAG passes additional relevant content from your domain-specific database to an LLM at generation time, alongside the original prompt or question, through a “context window\".\n\nAn LLM’s context window is its field of vision at a given moment. RAG is like holding up a cue card containing the critical points for your LLM to see, helping it produce more accurate responses incorporating essential data.\n\nTo understand RAG, we must first understand semantic search, which attempts to find the true meaning of the user’s query and retrieve relevant information instead of simply matching keywords in the user’s query. Semantic search aims to deliver results that better fit the user’s intent, not just their exact words.\n\n- Creating a vector database from your domain-specific proprietary data\n- Creating a vector database from your domain-specific proprietary data using an embedding model.\n  This diagram shows how you make a vector database from your domain-specific, proprietary data. To create your vector database, you convert your data into vectors by running it through an embedding model.\n\nAn embedding model is a type of LLM that converts data into vectors: arrays, or groups, of numbers. In the above example, we’re converting user manuals containing the ground truth for operating the latest Volvo vehicle, but your data could be text, images, video, or audio.\n\nThe most important thing to understand is that a vector represents the meaning of the input text, the same way another human would understand the essence if you spoke the text aloud. We convert our data to vectors so that computers can search for semantically similar items based on the numerical representation of the stored data.\n\nNext, you put the vectors into a vector database, like Pinecone. Pinecone’s vector database can search billions of items for similar matches in under a second.\n\nRemember that you can create vectors, ingest the vectors into the database, and update the index in real-time, solving the recency problem for the LLMs in your GenAI applications.\n\nFor example, you can write code that automatically creates vectors for your latest product offering and then upserts them in your index each time you launch a new product. Your company’s support chatbot application can then use RAG to retrieve up-to-date information about product availability and data about the current customer it’s chatting with.\n\n### Vector databases allow you to query data using natural language, which is ideal for chat interfaces.\n\nNow that your vector database contains numerical representations of your target data, you can perform a semantic search. Vector databases shine in semantic search use cases because end users form queries with ambiguous natural language.\n\n### Semantic search works by converting the user’s query into embeddings and using a vector database to search for similar entries.\n\nRetrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) uses semantic search to retrieve relevant context\nRetrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) uses semantic search to retrieve relevant and timely context that LLMs use to produce more accurate responses.\nYou originally converted your proprietary data into embeddings. When the user issues a query or question, you translate their natural language search terms into embeddings.\n\nYou send these embeddings to the vector database. The database performs a “nearest neighbor” search, finding the vectors that most closely resemble the user’s intent. When the vector database returns the relevant results, your application provides them to the LLM via its context window, prompting it to perform its generative task.\n\nRetrieval Augmented Generation reduces the likelihood of hallucinations by providing domain-specific information through an LLM's context window.\nRetrieval Augmented Generation reduces the likelihood of hallucinations by providing domain-specific information through an LLM's context window.\nSince the LLM now has access to the most pertinent and grounding facts from your vector database, it can provide an accurate answer for your user. RAG reduces the likelihood of hallucination.\n\n### Vector databases can support even more advanced search functionality.\n\nSemantic search is powerful, but it’s possible to go even further. For example, Pinecone’s vector database supports hybrid search functionality, a retrieval system that considers the query's semantics and keywords.\n\nRAG is the most cost-effective, easy to implement, and lowest-risk path to higher performance for GenAI applications.\nSemantic search and Retrieval Augmented Generation provide more relevant GenAI responses, translating to a superior experience for end-users. Unlike building your foundation model, fine-tuning an existing model, or solely performing prompt engineering, RAG simultaneously addresses recency and context-specific issues cost-effectively and with lower risk than alternative approaches.\n\n> Its primary purpose is to provide context-sensitive, detailed answers to questions that require access to private data to answer correctly.\n",

          "raw": "\nComic books are art in hundreds of ways, but perhaps the most undervalued of those ways – particularly in superhero comics – is their ability to make you belly laugh while wildly tragic events are unfolding. Sure, there are sad comic books and serious comic books and somber comic books, and the same can be said for comic book films. But if you love that first kind I mentioned in the same way that I do, I suspect you are going to have a grand time with The Marvels.\n\n### human than the franchise\n\nWith her inaugural outing in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Nia DaCosta directs the kind of film that leaves you grinning well after the credits roll. It’s made up of heart and soul and spirit and all of the piss and vinegar you’d expect from a story featuring three stellar leading ladies. Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) is more human than the franchise has ever allowed before this point, Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Parris) is as bright and bold as ever, and Ms. Marvel (Iman Vellani) predictably steals the show.\n\n### destruction of the Supreme Intelligence\n\nPerhaps what’s most refreshing here is that where Captain Marvel – despite its merits – felt like a living, breathing ad for military recruitment (no, really, there were literal Air Force ads), The Marvels is the antithesis of that. In fact, the primary conflict is centered on Carol Danvers’ wartime mistakes and their fallout. Our villain, Dar-Benn (Zawe Ashton), is a survivor of the Kree civil war that followed Captain Marvel’s destruction of the Supreme Intelligence, the AI that ruled over Dar-Benn’s home planet of Hala. Hala is dying as a result, and Dar-Benn will stop at nothing to save it and her people.\n\n### struggle with underdeveloped baddies\n\nWhile she’s certainly a sympathetic villain, Dar-Benn is unfortunately one of the weakest parts of The Marvels (through no fault of Ashton’s). Marvel struggled with undeveloped baddies in Phase 1, and it continues to struggle with underdeveloped baddies in Phase 5. She’s simply not given a whole lot to do beyond serving as the reason that Carol, Monica, and Kamala are together. Also, many of the Kree lackeys look pretty cool thanks to makeup and costume designs, but her right hand man is just some dude with a manbun (Ty-Rone, played by Daniel Ings). It’s strange!\n\n### opportunity to find closure\n\nAs Carol reckons with her mistakes, she is also given the opportunity to be a person. Don’t take that to mean that this is the Captain Marvel show, though: Despite the shift of focus in recent trailers, The Marvels very much centers on all three of its leads. Each member of the ensemble gets a full character arc, with their closing moments giving them the opportunity to find closure, peace, or a way forward. For this chapter, at least.\n\n### consequential happenings\n\nThat’s noteworthy not just because writers DaCosta, Megan McDonnell and Elissa Karasik had the tall task of cramming three complete storylines into the MCU’s shortest movie yet, but because The Marvels matters a great deal to the franchise as a whole. The ending and the post-credits scene set up very consequential happenings in this universe and beyond, and it leaves you just as it should: excitedly wondering where all of this could go next.\n\n### resolution for the Skrulls\n\nMaybe it will be some kind of resolution for the Skrulls, because watching this species get beaten down has gotten kind of tiring. They cannot catch a break, and neither Carol Danvers nor Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) is doing a damn thing about it. In that same vein, there may have been a version of this movie that tied to Secret Invasion, but it’s not the one coming to a theater near you. There is connective tissue to other MCU shows besides Ms. Marvel, but you’re going to have a hard time guessing which – and that’s a compliment.\n\n### Monica and Kamala\n\nFury deserves to be smacked by every Skrull he encounters, but the fact still remains that he is at his best alongside Carol Danvers. The same can now also be said for Monica and Kamala, as he acts as a mentor to the former and a role model to the other. He spends much of his time in The Marvels with Kamala’s family – a surprising and delightful pairing.\n\nThe Marvels' greatest strength is its ensemble, but the comedy is a close second\n\n### The Marvels simply understands\n\nThe Marvels’ greatest strength is most certainly its ensemble, but the comedy is a close second. A team-up to halt an intergalactic revenge plot isn’t a story that screams “hilarious”, but this one is brimming with laughs from start to finish. It evokes the silliness of DC’s Legends of Tomorrow more than once, and even goes slapstick a few times early on, all of which plays quite well and never at the expense of the film's downbeat moments. The Marvels simply understands that many of the things that unfold in superhero yarns – particularly this one – are deeply silly, or weird, or uncomfortable, and has no interest in self-seriousness in the face of that silliness and discomfort. Sometimes, the answer is to simply stop running from the Flerken.\n\n### What happened there\n\nSpeaking of Flerken, the visual effects here look quite solid. It’s amazing what can be accomplished when VFX artists are given time to cook, which is exactly what happened: The Marvels swapped release dates with Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, giving the teams behind this film more runway and their Quantumania counterparts, well… we all saw what happened there. The Marvels does have a couple of less-than-stellar frames but, on the whole, it is a vast improvement on recent MCU fare.\n\n### MCU\n\nDaCosta delivers a film with no bloat, tons of heart, and endless laughs. You can see bits and pieces of her style sprinkled throughout the film, even if the spots where the Marvel Machine took over are evident. If we’re very lucky, maybe we’ll see her return to the MCU for future projects. But, in the meantime, we can say for sure that this isn’t the end of Carol, Monica, or Kamala’s stories, and The Marvels will leave you wanting more of them immediately.\n\n### The Verdict\n\nThe Marvels is a triumph. Its depth can be seen not just through its characters, but through its story as it explores war's complicated fallout; the difficulty of being a human when you are perceived as a monolith; and the hilarious and complicated virtues of family. Both funny and heartfelt, Nia DaCosta’s MCU debut will have you asking when she and her leading ladies are coming back immediately after the credits roll. It’s a pity that the villain isn’t given much to do, though.\n",

However, the road to success for startups is often riddled with challenges, and one of the most significant contributing factors to failure is poor management. In this article, we will delve into the various aspects of how inadequate management can lead to startup failures.\n\n### Lack of Clear Vision and Strategy\n\nOne of the primary reasons startups fail due to poor management is the absence of a clear and well-defined vision and strategy. Without a strong vision, it becomes challenging to set specific goals and objectives, which in turn affects decision-making, resource allocation, and the overall direction of the company.\n\nEffective management involves creating a roadmap for the company's growth and ensuring that everyone within the organization understands and aligns with this vision. When management fails to articulate a clear direction, it can lead to confusion, conflicting priorities, and ultimately, the startup's demise.\n\n### Inadequate Planning and Execution\n\nPoor management often leads to inadequate planning and execution. Successful startups require meticulous planning, resource allocation, and execution of strategies. Without proper management, startups may struggle to set realistic timelines, allocate resources efficiently, and adapt to changing circumstances.\n\nIneffective execution can result in missed opportunities, increased costs, and delays in bringing products or services to market. Over time, these issues can lead to a loss of competitiveness and, ultimately, business failure.\n\n### Inefficient Resource Management\n\nResource management is another critical area where startups with poor management can falter. Efficient allocation of funds, time, and talent is essential for a company's growth. Inadequate financial management can lead to cash flow problems, insufficient capital to operate and scale the business, and excessive debt.\n\nHuman resource management is equally important. Inadequate team building, poor hiring decisions, and a lack of focus on talent development can undermine the startup's ability to deliver on its promises and meet customer expectations.\n\n### Neglecting Customer Needs and Feedback\n\nStartups that fail to succeed often neglect their customers' needs and feedback. Effective management involves building a strong customer-centric culture and incorporating customer feedback into the decision-making process. Startups that do not prioritize customer satisfaction can quickly lose market share and struggle to remain competitive.\n\n### Failure to Adapt and Innovate\n\nIn the dynamic world of business, adaptability and innovation are key to long-term success. Startups that fail to adapt to changing market conditions or innovate their products and services can quickly become obsolete. Poor management often hampers a company's ability to recognize and respond to evolving industry trends and customer preferences.\n\n### Weak Team Communication and Collaboration\n\nEffective teamwork and communication are vital to the success of any startup. Poor management can lead to a lack of transparency, misalignment of objectives, and a breakdown in team collaboration. When employees are not working together cohesively, it can result in inefficiencies, conflicts, and a loss of motivation, all of which can hinder the startup's growth and viability.\n\n### Neglecting Legal and Regulatory Compliance\n\nStartups are subject to a multitude of legal and regulatory requirements that vary by industry and jurisdiction. Poor management can result in neglecting compliance issues, leading to legal troubles and financial penalties. Failing to understand and adhere to relevant laws and regulations can be detrimental to a startup's reputation and financial stability.\n\n> Poor management is a significant contributing factor to startup failures. Startups that lack a clear vision, struggle with planning and execution, inefficiently manage resources, neglect customer needs and feedback, fail to adapt and innovate, have weak team communication and collaboration, and ignore legal and regulatory compliance issues are at a higher risk of failure. To increase the chances of success, startup founders and leaders must prioritize effective management practices, including strategic planning, resource management, and customer-centric approaches.\n",

          "raw": "\n### Introduction\n\nThe electric vehicle (EV) industry is at the forefront of a green revolution, offering a cleaner and more sustainable alternative to traditional internal combustion engine vehicles. Central to the success of EVs are their battery systems. These batteries are not only responsible for powering the vehicle but also significantly impact range, charging time, and overall cost. To make EVs more accessible and efficient, engineers are increasingly turning to generative AI, a technology that is quietly revolutionizing EV battery development.\n\n### The Role of Generative AI in EV Battery Development\n\nGenerative Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to a class of machine learning techniques that can automatically generate new designs, models, or solutions based on a set of inputs and desired outcomes. In the context of EV battery development, generative AI is helping researchers and engineers optimize the design and performance of lithium-ion batteries, which are the most common type of batteries used in EVs.\n\n### Material Selection and Optimization\n\nOne of the key areas where generative AI is making its mark is in the selection and optimization of battery materials. Advanced materials like cathodes, anodes, and electrolytes play a crucial role in determining the battery's energy density, longevity, and charging efficiency. Traditionally, this process involved a considerable amount of trial and error. Generative AI, on the other hand, can rapidly analyze vast databases of materials, predict their properties, and propose novel combinations that offer superior performance. This significantly accelerates the discovery of new materials that can boost battery efficiency and reduce costs.\n\n### Electrode Design\n\nGenerative AI is also assisting in the design of battery electrodes. By considering factors such as shape, structure, and composition, AI algorithms can create electrode designs that maximize energy storage capacity, increase power output, and extend battery life. This results in batteries that can provide longer driving ranges and quicker charging times.\n\n### Thermal Management\n\nOverheating is a major concern in EV batteries, as it can affect both performance and safety. Generative AI is being employed to develop advanced thermal management systems that efficiently dissipate heat and maintain optimal operating temperatures. This not only enhances the longevity of the battery but also improves safety, reducing the risk of thermal runaway incidents.\n\n### Cycle Life Prediction\n\nLithium-ion batteries degrade over time due to charge-discharge cycles. Generative AI models are capable of predicting how a battery will degrade over time based on its usage patterns and environmental conditions. This enables more accurate estimations of a battery's lifecycle and helps manufacturers design more durable and reliable battery systems.\n\n### Manufacturing Optimization\n\nGenerative AI is also aiding in the optimization of battery manufacturing processes. By analyzing production data, AI algorithms can identify inefficiencies, recommend process improvements, and help reduce production costs. This leads to more affordable EV batteries, making electric vehicles more accessible to a broader range of consumers.\n\n### Challenges and Ethical Considerations\n\nWhile generative AI holds immense promise in the EV battery development landscape, it also comes with its set of challenges and ethical considerations. Ensuring data security and privacy, addressing potential biases in AI models, and maintaining transparency in decision-making processes are all important issues that need to be addressed as this technology becomes more integrated into the industry.\n\n\n> Generative AI is quietly but profoundly reshaping the field of EV battery development. By streamlining material selection, optimizing design, enhancing thermal management, predicting cycle life, and improving manufacturing processes, generative AI is accelerating the evolution of EV battery technology. As electric vehicles become more prevalent, the innovations driven by AI will be essential in creating batteries that are not only more efficient but also more affordable and sustainable. As the EV industry continues to grow, the role of generative AI in battery development will only become more prominent, paving the way for cleaner and greener transportation options\n\n\n\n\n",

          "raw": "\n\n\nUntil now, trying to style an article, document, or blog post with Tailwind has been a tedious task that required a keen eye for typography and a lot of complex custom CSS.\n\nBy default, Tailwind removes all of the default browser styling from paragraphs, headings, lists and more. This ends up being really useful for building application UIs because you spend less time undoing user-agent styles, but when you _really are_ just trying to style some content that came from a rich-text editor in a CMS or a markdown file, it can be surprising and unintuitive.\n\nWe get lots of complaints about it actually, with people regularly asking us things like:\n\n> Why is Tailwind removing the default styles on my `h1` elements? How do I disable this? What do you mean I lose all the other base styles too?\n> We hear you, but we're not convinced that simply disabling our base styles is what you really want. You don't want to have to remove annoying margins every time you use a `p` element in a piece of your dashboard UI. And I doubt you really want your blog posts to use the user-agent styles either — you want them to look _awesome_, not awful.\n\nThe `@tailwindcss/typography` plugin is our attempt to give you what you _actually_ want, without any of the downsides of doing something stupid like disabling our base styles.\n\nIt adds a new `prose` class that you can slap on any block of vanilla HTML content and turn it into a beautiful, well-formatted document:\n\n```html\n<article className=\"prose\">\n  <h1>Garlic bread with cheese: What the science tells us</h1>\n  <p>\n    For years parents have espoused the health benefits of eating garlic bread\n    with cheese to their children, with the food earning such an iconic status\n    in our culture that kids will often dress up as warm, cheesy loaf for\n    Halloween.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    But a recent study shows that the celebrated appetizer may be linked to a\n    series of rabies cases springing up around the country.\n  </p>\n</article>\n```\n\nFor more information about how to use the plugin and the features it includes, [read the documentation](https://github.com/tailwindcss/typography/blob/master/README.md).\n\n---\n\n## What to expect from here on out\n\nWhat follows from here is just a bunch of absolute nonsense I've written to dogfood the plugin itself. It includes every sensible typographic element I could think of, like **bold text**, unordered lists, ordered lists, code blocks, block quotes, _and even italics_.\n\nIt's important to cover all of these use cases for a few reasons:\n\n1.  We want everything to look good out of the box.\n2.  Really just the first reason, that's the whole point of the plugin.\n3.  Here's a third pretend reason though a list with three items looks more realistic than a list with two items.\n\nNow we're going to try out another header style.\n\n### Typography should be easy\n\nSo that's a header for you — with any luck if we've done our job correctly that will look pretty reasonable.\n\nSomething a wise person once told me about typography is:\n\n> Typography is pretty important if you don't want your stuff to look like trash. Make it good then it won't be bad.\n\nIt's probably important that images look okay here by default as well:\n\n<Image\n  src=\"/blogs/c-d-x-PDX_a_82obo-unsplash.jpg\"\n  width=\"718\"\n  height=\"404\"\n  alt=\"Image\"\n  sizes=\"100vw\"\n/>\n\nContrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old.\n\nNow I'm going to show you an example of an unordered list to make sure that looks good, too:\n\n- So here is the first item in this list.\n- In this example we're keeping the items short.\n- Later, we'll use longer, more complex list items.\n\nAnd that's the end of this section.\n\n## What if we stack headings?\n\n### We should make sure that looks good, too.\n\nSometimes you have headings directly underneath each other. In those cases you often have to undo the top margin on the second heading because it usually looks better for the headings to be closer together than a paragraph followed by a heading should be.\n\n### When a heading comes after a paragraph …\n\nWhen a heading comes after a paragraph, we need a bit more space, like I already mentioned above. Now let's see what a more complex list would look like.\n\n- **I often do this thing where list items have headings.**\n\n  For some reason I think this looks cool which is unfortunate because it's pretty annoying to get the styles right.\n\n  I often have two or three paragraphs in these list items, too, so the hard part is getting the spacing between the paragraphs, list item heading, and separate list items to all make sense. Pretty tough honestly, you could make a strong argument that you just shouldn't write this way.\n\n- **Since this is a list, I need at least two items.**\n\n  I explained what I'm doing already in the previous list item, but a list wouldn't be a list if it only had one item, and we really want this to look realistic. That's why I've added this second list item so I actually have something to look at when writing the styles.\n\n- **It's not a bad idea to add a third item either.**\n\n  I think it probably would've been fine to just use two items but three is definitely not worse, and since I seem to be having no trouble making up arbitrary things to type, I might as well include it.\n\nAfter this sort of list I usually have a closing statement or paragraph, because it kinda looks weird jumping right to a heading.\n\n## Code should look okay by default.\n\nI think most people are going to use [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) or [Prism](https://prismjs.com/) or something if they want to style their code blocks but it wouldn't hurt to make them look _okay_ out of the box, even with no syntax highlighting.\n\nHere's what a default `tailwind.config.js` file looks like at the time of writing:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  purge: [],\n  theme: {\n    extend: {},\n  },\n  variants: {},\n  plugins: [],\n}\n```\n\nHopefully that looks good enough to you.\n\n### What about nested lists?\n\nNested lists basically always look bad which is why editors like Medium don't even let you do it, but I guess since some of you goofballs are going to do it we have to carry the burden of at least making it work.\n\n1.  **Nested lists are rarely a good idea.**\n    - You might feel like you are being really \"organized\" or something but you are just creating a gross shape on the screen that is hard to read.\n    - Nested navigation in UIs is a bad idea too, keep things as flat as possible.\n    - Nesting tons of folders in your source code is also not helpful.\n2.  **Since we need to have more items, here's another one.**\n    - I'm not sure if we'll bother styling more than two levels deep.\n    - Two is already too much, three is guaranteed to be a bad idea.\n    - If you nest four levels deep you belong in prison.\n3.  **Two items isn't really a list, three is good though.**\n    - Again please don't nest lists if you want people to actually read your content.\n    - Nobody wants to look at this.\n    - I'm upset that we even have to bother styling this.\n\nThe most annoying thing about lists in Markdown is that `<li>` elements aren't given a child `<p>` tag unless there are multiple paragraphs in the list item. That means I have to worry about styling that annoying situation too.\n\n- **For example, here's another nested list.**\n\n  But this time with a second paragraph.\n\n  - These list items won't have `<p>` tags\n  - Because they are only one line each\n\n- **But in this second top-level list item, they will.**\n\n  This is especially annoying because of the spacing on this paragraph.\n\n  - As you can see here, because I've added a second line, this list item now has a `<p>` tag.\n\n    This is the second line I'm talking about by the way.\n\n  - Finally here's another list item so it's more like a list.\n\n- A closing list item, but with no nested list, because why not?\n\nAnd finally a sentence to close off this section.\n\n## There are other elements we need to style\n\nI almost forgot to mention links, like [this link to the Tailwind CSS website](https://tailwindcss.com). We almost made them blue but that's so yesterday, so we went with dark gray, feels edgier.\n\nWe even included table styles, check it out:\n\n| Wrestler                | Origin       | Finisher           |\n| ----------------------- | ------------ | ------------------ |\n| Bret \"The Hitman\" Hart  | Calgary, AB  | Sharpshooter       |\n| Stone Cold Steve Austin | Austin, TX   | Stone Cold Stunner |\n| Randy Savage            | Sarasota, FL | Elbow Drop         |\n| Vader                   | Boulder, CO  | Vader Bomb         |\n| Razor Ramon             | Chuluota, FL | Razor's Edge       |\n\nWe also need to make sure inline code looks good, like if I wanted to talk about `<span>` elements or tell you the good news about `@tailwindcss/typography`.\n\n### Sometimes I even use `code` in headings\n\nEven though it's probably a bad idea, and historically I've had a hard time making it look good. This _\"wrap the code blocks in backticks\"_ trick works pretty well though really.\n\nAnother thing I've done in the past is put a `code` tag inside of a link, like if I wanted to tell you about the [`tailwindcss/docs`](https://github.com/tailwindcss/docs) repository. I don't love that there is an underline below the backticks but it is absolutely not worth the madness it would require to avoid it.\n\n#### We haven't used an `h4` yet\n\nBut now we have. Please don't use `h5` or `h6` in your content, Medium only supports two heading levels for a reason, you animals. I honestly considered using a `before` pseudo-element to scream at you if you use an `h5` or `h6`.\n\nWe don't style them at all out of the box because `h4` elements are already so small that they are the same size as the body copy. What are we supposed to do with an `h5`, make it _smaller_ than the body copy? No thanks.\n\n### We still need to think about stacked headings though.\n\n#### Let's make sure we don't screw that up with `h4` elements, either.\n\nPhew, with any luck we have styled the headings above this text and they look pretty good.\n\nLet's add a closing paragraph here so things end with a decently sized block of text. I can't explain why I want things to end that way but I have to assume it's because I think things will look weird or unbalanced if there is a heading too close to the end of the document.\n\nWhat I've written here is probably long enough, but adding this final sentence can't hurt.\n\n## GitHub Flavored Markdown\n\nI've also added support for GitHub Flavored Mardown using `remark-gfm`.\n\nWith `remark-gfm`, we get a few extra features in our markdown. Example: autolink literals.\n\nA link like www.example.com or https://example.com would automatically be converted into an `a` tag.\n\nThis works for email links too: contact@example.com.",

          "raw": "\n\n\nUntil now, trying to style an article, document, or blog post with Tailwind has been a tedious task that required a keen eye for typography and a lot of complex custom CSS.\n\nBy default, Tailwind removes all of the default browser styling from paragraphs, headings, lists and more. This ends up being really useful for building application UIs because you spend less time undoing user-agent styles, but when you _really are_ just trying to style some content that came from a rich-text editor in a CMS or a markdown file, it can be surprising and unintuitive.\n\nWe get lots of complaints about it actually, with people regularly asking us things like:\n\n> Why is Tailwind removing the default styles on my `h1` elements? How do I disable this? What do you mean I lose all the other base styles too?\n> We hear you, but we're not convinced that simply disabling our base styles is what you really want. You don't want to have to remove annoying margins every time you use a `p` element in a piece of your dashboard UI. And I doubt you really want your blog posts to use the user-agent styles either — you want them to look _awesome_, not awful.\n\nThe `@tailwindcss/typography` plugin is our attempt to give you what you _actually_ want, without any of the downsides of doing something stupid like disabling our base styles.\n\nIt adds a new `prose` class that you can slap on any block of vanilla HTML content and turn it into a beautiful, well-formatted document:\n\n```html\n<article className=\"prose\">\n  <h1>Garlic bread with cheese: What the science tells us</h1>\n  <p>\n    For years parents have espoused the health benefits of eating garlic bread\n    with cheese to their children, with the food earning such an iconic status\n    in our culture that kids will often dress up as warm, cheesy loaf for\n    Halloween.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    But a recent study shows that the celebrated appetizer may be linked to a\n    series of rabies cases springing up around the country.\n  </p>\n</article>\n```\n\nFor more information about how to use the plugin and the features it includes, [read the documentation](https://github.com/tailwindcss/typography/blob/master/README.md).\n\n---\n\n## What to expect from here on out\n\nWhat follows from here is just a bunch of absolute nonsense I've written to dogfood the plugin itself. It includes every sensible typographic element I could think of, like **bold text**, unordered lists, ordered lists, code blocks, block quotes, _and even italics_.\n\nIt's important to cover all of these use cases for a few reasons:\n\n1.  We want everything to look good out of the box.\n2.  Really just the first reason, that's the whole point of the plugin.\n3.  Here's a third pretend reason though a list with three items looks more realistic than a list with two items.\n\nNow we're going to try out another header style.\n\n### Typography should be easy\n\nSo that's a header for you — with any luck if we've done our job correctly that will look pretty reasonable.\n\nSomething a wise person once told me about typography is:\n\n> Typography is pretty important if you don't want your stuff to look like trash. Make it good then it won't be bad.\n\nIt's probably important that images look okay here by default as well:\n\n<Image\n  src=\"/blogs/c-d-x-PDX_a_82obo-unsplash.jpg\"\n  width=\"718\"\n  height=\"404\"\n  alt=\"Image\"\n  sizes=\"100vw\"\n/>\n\nContrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old.\n\nNow I'm going to show you an example of an unordered list to make sure that looks good, too:\n\n- So here is the first item in this list.\n- In this example we're keeping the items short.\n- Later, we'll use longer, more complex list items.\n\nAnd that's the end of this section.\n\n## What if we stack headings?\n\n### We should make sure that looks good, too.\n\nSometimes you have headings directly underneath each other. In those cases you often have to undo the top margin on the second heading because it usually looks better for the headings to be closer together than a paragraph followed by a heading should be.\n\n### When a heading comes after a paragraph …\n\nWhen a heading comes after a paragraph, we need a bit more space, like I already mentioned above. Now let's see what a more complex list would look like.\n\n- **I often do this thing where list items have headings.**\n\n  For some reason I think this looks cool which is unfortunate because it's pretty annoying to get the styles right.\n\n  I often have two or three paragraphs in these list items, too, so the hard part is getting the spacing between the paragraphs, list item heading, and separate list items to all make sense. Pretty tough honestly, you could make a strong argument that you just shouldn't write this way.\n\n- **Since this is a list, I need at least two items.**\n\n  I explained what I'm doing already in the previous list item, but a list wouldn't be a list if it only had one item, and we really want this to look realistic. That's why I've added this second list item so I actually have something to look at when writing the styles.\n\n- **It's not a bad idea to add a third item either.**\n\n  I think it probably would've been fine to just use two items but three is definitely not worse, and since I seem to be having no trouble making up arbitrary things to type, I might as well include it.\n\nAfter this sort of list I usually have a closing statement or paragraph, because it kinda looks weird jumping right to a heading.\n\n## Code should look okay by default.\n\nI think most people are going to use [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) or [Prism](https://prismjs.com/) or something if they want to style their code blocks but it wouldn't hurt to make them look _okay_ out of the box, even with no syntax highlighting.\n\nHere's what a default `tailwind.config.js` file looks like at the time of writing:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  purge: [],\n  theme: {\n    extend: {},\n  },\n  variants: {},\n  plugins: [],\n}\n```\n\nHopefully that looks good enough to you.\n\n### What about nested lists?\n\nNested lists basically always look bad which is why editors like Medium don't even let you do it, but I guess since some of you goofballs are going to do it we have to carry the burden of at least making it work.\n\n1.  **Nested lists are rarely a good idea.**\n    - You might feel like you are being really \"organized\" or something but you are just creating a gross shape on the screen that is hard to read.\n    - Nested navigation in UIs is a bad idea too, keep things as flat as possible.\n    - Nesting tons of folders in your source code is also not helpful.\n2.  **Since we need to have more items, here's another one.**\n    - I'm not sure if we'll bother styling more than two levels deep.\n    - Two is already too much, three is guaranteed to be a bad idea.\n    - If you nest four levels deep you belong in prison.\n3.  **Two items isn't really a list, three is good though.**\n    - Again please don't nest lists if you want people to actually read your content.\n    - Nobody wants to look at this.\n    - I'm upset that we even have to bother styling this.\n\nThe most annoying thing about lists in Markdown is that `<li>` elements aren't given a child `<p>` tag unless there are multiple paragraphs in the list item. That means I have to worry about styling that annoying situation too.\n\n- **For example, here's another nested list.**\n\n  But this time with a second paragraph.\n\n  - These list items won't have `<p>` tags\n  - Because they are only one line each\n\n- **But in this second top-level list item, they will.**\n\n  This is especially annoying because of the spacing on this paragraph.\n\n  - As you can see here, because I've added a second line, this list item now has a `<p>` tag.\n\n    This is the second line I'm talking about by the way.\n\n  - Finally here's another list item so it's more like a list.\n\n- A closing list item, but with no nested list, because why not?\n\nAnd finally a sentence to close off this section.\n\n## There are other elements we need to style\n\nI almost forgot to mention links, like [this link to the Tailwind CSS website](https://tailwindcss.com). We almost made them blue but that's so yesterday, so we went with dark gray, feels edgier.\n\nWe even included table styles, check it out:\n\n| Wrestler                | Origin       | Finisher           |\n| ----------------------- | ------------ | ------------------ |\n| Bret \"The Hitman\" Hart  | Calgary, AB  | Sharpshooter       |\n| Stone Cold Steve Austin | Austin, TX   | Stone Cold Stunner |\n| Randy Savage            | Sarasota, FL | Elbow Drop         |\n| Vader                   | Boulder, CO  | Vader Bomb         |\n| Razor Ramon             | Chuluota, FL | Razor's Edge       |\n\nWe also need to make sure inline code looks good, like if I wanted to talk about `<span>` elements or tell you the good news about `@tailwindcss/typography`.\n\n### Sometimes I even use `code` in headings\n\nEven though it's probably a bad idea, and historically I've had a hard time making it look good. This _\"wrap the code blocks in backticks\"_ trick works pretty well though really.\n\nAnother thing I've done in the past is put a `code` tag inside of a link, like if I wanted to tell you about the [`tailwindcss/docs`](https://github.com/tailwindcss/docs) repository. I don't love that there is an underline below the backticks but it is absolutely not worth the madness it would require to avoid it.\n\n#### We haven't used an `h4` yet\n\nBut now we have. Please don't use `h5` or `h6` in your content, Medium only supports two heading levels for a reason, you animals. I honestly considered using a `before` pseudo-element to scream at you if you use an `h5` or `h6`.\n\nWe don't style them at all out of the box because `h4` elements are already so small that they are the same size as the body copy. What are we supposed to do with an `h5`, make it _smaller_ than the body copy? No thanks.\n\n### We still need to think about stacked headings though.\n\n#### Let's make sure we don't screw that up with `h4` elements, either.\n\nPhew, with any luck we have styled the headings above this text and they look pretty good.\n\nLet's add a closing paragraph here so things end with a decently sized block of text. I can't explain why I want things to end that way but I have to assume it's because I think things will look weird or unbalanced if there is a heading too close to the end of the document.\n\nWhat I've written here is probably long enough, but adding this final sentence can't hurt.\n\n## GitHub Flavored Markdown\n\nI've also added support for GitHub Flavored Mardown using `remark-gfm`.\n\nWith `remark-gfm`, we get a few extra features in our markdown. Example: autolink literals.\n\nA link like www.example.com or https://example.com would automatically be converted into an `a` tag.\n\nThis works for email links too: contact@example.com.",

          "raw": "\nLast week, cloud computing company Shadow confirmed a data breach involving customers’ personal information. The hacker claims to have access to the data of more than 530,000 customers. According to an email from Shadow CEO Eric Sèle, the hacker managed to download this data from a software-as-a-service (SaaS) provider’s API. This is just a recent example in a long list of data breaches that have affected companies of all sizes.\n\nAnd if you’re a tech CEO, you probably don’t want to be in that position. In the current regulatory landscape, you often have to notify privacy watchdogs and navigate regulatory obligations. More importantly, you risk losing the trust of your clients when you notify them of the breach.\n\n### Why Zygon caught my attention\n\nThat’s the reason why Zygon caught my attention. This new French startup reviews all the SaaS applications used by your team — and it doesn’t just focus on official services as it can identify shadow SaaS services that some teams have been quietly using without telling the IT department.\n\nAt first, I thought Zygon could be particularly useful as a cost saving service. As many VC firms are still passing on deals that would have made sense a few years ago, some startups are actively reviewing their SaaS contracts to see if they can cancel a few subscriptions and extend their runway.\n\n### Startup is expanding\n\nBut the startup wants to go beyond this initial usage and build a security startup for your SaaS services. Zygon recently raised a $3 million seed round with Axeleo Capital leading the round, Kima Ventures and several business angels also participating.\n\n### Visibility on shadow IT\n\nAfter the initial inventory process, Zygon customers get a dashboard with all the SaaS applications with the number of users per application.\n\n### Metadata of employee\n\n“We are using the metadata of employee emails, we go through the entire email history and detect those that are related to a SaaS usage,” Zygon co-founder and Chief Product Officer Kevin Smouts told me.\n\nFor SaaS applications that are connected to the official identity management solution, such as Okta, Zygon isn’t going to be particularly useful. But some SaaS startups have been particularly successful in recent years because it takes just a few minutes to create an account and get started.\n\n### Promotion\n\nThey are taking advantage of that by promoting bottom-up adoption with freemium plans, self-service usage and virality features. Dropbox, Zoom or Notion are popular examples of this trend.\n\nAnd SaaS sprawl creates three different issues for businesses — security, legal and costs.\n\n### Building integration\n\nInstead of building integration with every single SaaS product on earth, Zygon is using the same approach and decentralizing security across the organization. Zygon encourages you to designate SaaS admins. From now on, they are in charge of the usage of a specific tool in the organization.\n\n### Security configuration\n\nThey get recommendations when it comes to security configuration tasks, multi-factor authentication and more. For popular application, IT departments can take over as admins, prioritize the rollout of SSO authentication to control account orchestration and more.\n\n### SaaS usage\n\nMore generally speaking, Zygon brings some sort of control over SaaS usage. If someone has multiple accounts for the same service, Zygon can flag that. If several employees are sharing an account, Zygon can also identify that. And if a company wants to comply with SOC 2 and ISO frameworks, Zygon can mitigate risks by minimizing the attack surface.\n\n### Zygon\n\nZygon can be particularly useful when someone quits or when there is a wave of layoffs. It can list services that are still active even after an employee has left the company.\n\n> “In the current situation, IT is only in control of a very small number of SaaS applications. And most accounts remain active for a very long time after employees’ departures — in the current context of layoffs, these are gaping security holes. We go further by detecting which SaaS applications have APIs or access keys that also need to be ‘rotated’ in the event of an employee departure,” Smouts said.\n",
